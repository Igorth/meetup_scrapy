"We are Alice, Brianna, Megan, Paula, and Tabitha and we are Team #WeLive of the 2016 Mongol Rally! ( The Mongol Rally is a ludicrous non-race that
  crosses 10,000 miles from England to Russia in tiny cars organized by
  the Adventurists. Yeah.) This crazy trek came to be through a series of winding events
  starting back in early 2015 and has bloomed into a modern day Fox
  Force Five. We are all passionate about women's rights, which is why
  we're interviewing women's rights groups along our route to produce an
  e-book about their needs upon our return. Why are we raising money? So we can GET to these places! We need money for petrol and chaos in
  order to get to the finish line and come home to write this book.
   Help us keep our tanks full, our cars in one piece, and our patooties
  out of trouble. What Makes Us Different We're one of the very few all-female teams participating in the
  Mongol Rally. And we're definitely the only team highlighting women's
  rights issues along our way. We also hope to inspire other women and
  girls to get out there and explore! How You Can Help Whether it's $5 or $500 we are SO THANKFUL for your help! However you
  choose to contribute is amazing. You can choose a perk or not...not
  matter what, we're totally stoked on your help! Follow Our Progress Find us on Facebook and Instagram for live updates of where we are and the

"The Mongol Charity Rally July 19th 2015 TEAM: ARE WE THERE YET Just 4 guys who’ll be living their life in a car, For 4ish weeks,
  rallying 10,000+ miles from the London UK to Ulan Ude Siberia The rules of the Rally are simple… 1. You can only take a farcically small vehicle 1L or less 2.
  You’re completely on your own 3. You've got to raise at least
  £1000 for charity That’s it!!!!- How we get there is up to us….. But Before we do it we'll need some assistance, your assistance, see
  ten-thousand miles + is quite a long distance in a 1litre or less car!
  Not to mention the same to return, that’s why we need to start early… Let us introduce ourselves. We are a group of adventurers fundraising
  in order to take part in a charity road rally called The Mongol Rally 2015. We call ourselves ARE WE THERE YET , in our
  team are Myself - (Andrew Takle), Andrew Ely, George Hockin &
  Lewis Don who have known each other since wee boys. Our team, along with some 300 others, will be travelling past
  countless landmarks, tourist attractions, lakes, seas, deserts, cities
  and mountain ranges as each vehicle makes their own unique route
  through countless countries. There is no set path and no support, we will be on our own facing the
  very real threat of carjacking and kidnappings, Bribery and robberies..... All things which have happened in past rallies. The rare trip offers a once in a lifetime adventure 1 of the best
  things we could do in our lives and all for charity. We are under no
  illusions that this will be easy, we cant even begin to imagine the
  dangers we will face along the way. But along the route we will
  experience a wide range of cultures and spices and even nod or smile
  if we don’t quite understand the language being used. which could be a
  problem since none of us speak a foreign language. we'll be able to
  share our journey around the world by recording our trip with lots of
  videos with our onboard dash cam and take many many photos. And yes we
  are 4 grown men in our twenty’s who will feel like teenagers again. We will also be supporting 2 charities, The Dorset & Somerset Air
  Ambulance and Cool Earth.. Cool Earth is the official charity of the Mongol Rally and is
  supported by every team taking part in the race. One of the rally rules state that at least a £1000 needs to be raised
  for charity half of which can be donated to our chosen charity The
  Dorset & Somerset Air Ambulance. This trip requires a massive amount of planning and funding We will
  be driving through harsh environments Your donation here on this page
  will help us cover a few of the initial fees and expenses involved in
  the Rally. We need to pay a deposit of £1000 to ensure no cars are
  abandoned along the way, a £ 500 entry fee but the biggest cost would
  be the car’s own passport which could cost up £850 depending on the
  countries we choose to drive through. Not to mention the visa’s and
  additional driving permits etc etc as a donor you’ll be able to check
  my face book page and check the progress of the trip and help us raise
  money for the chosen charities GET THE WORD OUT! And thank you for your support. THE CHARITIES: The Dorset & Somerset Air Ambulance The Dorset & Somerset Air Ambulance is a registered charity, which uses a helicopter to provide an air
  ambulance service to the English counties of Dorset and Somerset. Typical incidents for which the assistance of the air ambulance is
  requested by South Western Ambulance Service, include road traffic
  collisions and horse riding accidents, due to the remote locations and
  the severity of injuries involved in such incidents. The helicopter is leased from Bond Air Services and costs in excess
  of £4,000 per day to run and this money has to be raised largely from
  charitable donations. The charity is supported by volunteers spread
  across the two counties who work to raise funds to ensure that this
  service continues. It also runs a weekly lottery which has, to date,
  over 50,000 members. COOL EARTH We know that saving the rainforest isn’t a new idea. Managing to do
  it is. Over the last 40 years, half the world’s rainforests have been
  destroyed. That’s why Cool Earth decided to go about things differently. We don’t create reserves or put up fences. We don’t buy land.
  Instead, we put indigenous people back in control of the world’s most
  endangered rainforest. These people have lived in the forest for
  countless generations. Their homes are now on the frontline of
  deforestation. They have the most to lose from deforestation. Cool Earth is now working alongside 65 rainforest villages throughout
  the world. These partner villages are protecting over 350,000
  acres of forest that lie directly in the path of chainsaws and bulldozers. The clever part is that this forest is forming a shield to make the
  neighbouring forest inaccessible to loggers – saving millions of acres
  of further forest. THANKYOU  :)",283,of £1k goal,https://fundrazr.com/8s6ca,THE MONGOL CHARITY RALLY 2015 FUNDRAISER,10,Pound Sterling

"My twin sister Cyanne and I [Zia] are amazing, motivated 22-year-olds
  who are currently studying TAFE externally from home. We are both in
  electric wheelchairs with a condition called Muscular Dystrophy, which
  is a weakness of the muscles. Having been confined to wheelchairs
  since the age of eight, we have needed ongoing assistance with
  transport. Now, we use electric wheelchairs, which require more room
  than our original manual wheelchairs. A recent, new addition to the family, our baby brother Jayden, and
  ongoing mechanical and access issues with our current transport
  option, a 2003 Transit van, which was modified to accommodate the our
  needs, is in desperate need of replacement. Our existing van has become increasingly unreliable for both local,
  and travel to Adelaide. This means accessing specialist appointments
  has not been able to occur, due to no other transport options being
  viable. Our electric wheelchairs cannot be serviced locally so this is
  rapidly becoming a major issue with no reliable way of accessing
  services. Local travel, as a family group, is not an option, as there
  is no provision for a baby seat for Jayden in the van. The existing
  seatbelts are very cumbersome, compared with modern wheelchair
  restraints. Cyanne is currently unable to access the van without
  bending over, a very uncomfortable position to be in, as her head
  extends above the height of her wheelchair. There are also issues with
  the current access ramp, which extends out the back of the vehicle,
  regarding both of our safety, as we are deposited on the road. As we
  have grown, we are no longer able to see out the windows, which
  certainly makes for an uncomfortable and boring trip. The time has definitely arrived to look at replacing the van with a
  more up to date version that can be modified to suit the changed needs
  of my sister and me and including our family. We have researched the
  many options that are currently available and have found a suitable replacement. The Renault Trafic vehicle with CAPITAL PLUS+, has many features that
  are necessary for safe transport of all family members including: Renault LWB L2H1 Trafic Integral with AUTOMATIC transmission Dual Air conditioning Windows in rear area x4 Rear floor covering and interior trimmings Slip resistant vinyl flooring (in wheelchair area) for
    easy cleaning and wheelchair manoeuvrability Lowered floor, side door entry design providing quick and
    easy access for all passengers Manual slide out ramp system Seating for 4 passengers, plus driver Single front
    passenger seat One removable & relocatable middle
    seat Two single fixed rear seats Two wheelchair positions with one tie-down and occupant
    seat belts Base Vehicle Price:      $40,301.75 inc GST + ORC Conversion
  Price :       $52,309.40 Total Price :                $92,611.15 * Price does not include registration,
    statutory charges or delivery (if applicable). This is the cost that we are seeking your assistance in funding, in
  part or the whole cost, as it is currently beyond our financial means.
  We are both deserving recipients of your support and would benefit
  enormously from the provision of an upgraded van that accommodates our
  current needs to give us access to the everyday pleasures others, who
  are not wheelchair bound, enjoy with family. If you can help in any way possible, it would be greatly appreciated.",500,of $92.6k goal,https://fundrazr.com/cng8d,Help Cyanne and Zia raise money for a new van,6,Australian Dollar

    -Dalai Lama Have you ever had a moment when you were awake but felt like you were dreaming? I've had a dream of traveling to West Africa, playing and laughing
  with the children, spending time in local communities and schools
  teaching photography, help them fight illiteracy, and educate ways for
  a better health and wellness. All the while, learning so much from them. With your help, we can make this dream come true!  Being a cancer
  survivor, I have always felt limited when it came to achieving goals
  and dreams. It took some time to overcome that. There have been
  numerous difficult times accomplishing them with hearing and vision
  disabilities. With this being my second time traveling to Africa, and
  my 4th time out of country, I now feel ready to take on this endeavor
  independently, but made possible with your financial support. This is
  a fundraiser for a summer photographic excursion to Dakar, Senegal and
  Brikama, Gambia summer 2014 documenting the West African culture,
  lifestyle, food, music, beautiful people, energetic children, the
  natural wonders, and history of the countries. In addition to giving
  back by teaching my expertise with the Always Friends Kids Club in
  Dakar. I will also volunteer with Women's Federated Nursery School in
  Brikama, Gambia, while participating with the local girls' and boys'
  soccer team on the weekends. I will share the stories of the people I
  meet along the way for a photo exhibit and a short film, upon my
  return and with my contributors during the trip. While there, I will
  take advantage of the opportunity to be with friends and family whom I
  have not seen in a while or have not personally met.  It is a blessing
  and allows even closer interactions, that they will host me while in town. The first time traveling to Africa was to Ghana in 2011 with the
  organization called Operation Crossroads Africa, where 10 participants
  including myself, spent two months with a home stay family. We were
  volunteer teachers, health advocates, and construction workers,
  building a clinic in a local village. It was such a great experience!
  To see some of the photos from Ghana, West Africa, please visit My Flickr Page . ""If you had one shot, one opportunity to seize everything
    you've ever wanted, in one moment, would you capture it or let it

  this ever learning and ever growing journey with me. When you donate,
  you will get to travel along with me, with a link to a blog that will
  be created for this trip, that includes very descriptive details of my
  days, to the point where you will feel like you are there with me. You
  can also receive access to a limited edition photo book, prints of
  your choice, whether it is of children, the landscapes, the cultural
  events, or even animals, in addition to an exclusive first look into
  a photo exhibit from my travels. The travel budget is $5,000 for 30 days. Your contribution will help
  with gifts for the host families and some students, disposable cameras
  for the children, leisure activities, and local transportation. Any donation amount means so much to me! Knowing you support
  this endeavor brings me such joy & happiness! You can donate through this website, or gift donatations can be made

"We're almost there! Help us raise Zoe's final payments for her
  Chorale tour of Italy in June! The opportunity of a lifetime, for a great kid who has worked hard
  for the opportunity.  The nationally and internationally acclaimed
  Colorado Springs Children's Chorale will be touring Italy in June and
  July, performing at numerous stops around the country, including a
  Mass at Saint Peter's Basilica in Vatican City.  They go to share
  their message of music and kids, and friendship through music.  Being
  a part of this trip is a dream and an honor for Zoe, who has been
  performing with the Chorale for three years, and will be one of the
  youngest members making the trip. Zoe has ancestral family in Italy,
  making this trip even more special to her and her family. Any excess funds raised will be used to help other members of
  Children's Chorale who need help making final payments, or simply
  donated to the Colorado Springs Children's Chorale, a fantastic
  nonprofit organization, to help them continue teaching and creating
  young vocalists.   Zoe will be presenting the final payment herself,
  and any excess monies will be donated in the name of Friends of Zoe
  Chavez.  Thanks so much for reading, and for supporting a great kid,
  and a great cause! In Zoe's own words: Hi, I am Zoe, and I am a normal 11 year old kid. Children's Chorale
  is the most important part of my life. Chorale has already allowed me
  to have some wonderful experiences that I hope to keep with me
  forever. As a part of Chorale, I have already been many places that I
  probably would not have visited on my own, like Aspen, Colorado, and
  Bardstown, Kentucky. I have also met people from Fujiyoshida, Japan.
  They were so nice, and taught me so many things that I didn’t know
  about their country and culture. I even learned how to write my name
  using calligraphy! Later this year, I get to have an experience that most kids my age
  could never dream of having! I am going to Italy in late June to
  spread our message of song and music to people on a completely
  different side of the world. But besides the amazing traveling
  opportunities, and great people I get to see and meet, there is much
  more to Chorale than just that for me. To me, Chorale isn’t just a group of kids. Chorale is a big family of
  people who all share the same passion, a love of music. I don’t have
  any siblings, but Chorale is where I have the chance to have a great
  big group of brothers and sisters. If I am having a bad day, I know
  that when I walk into the practice room at Chorale, my sadness will
  just float right off of me, because music is the best thing ever! That
  is what being a part of Chorale means to me. Thanks for reading, and
  thanks for helping me out! Love, Zoe",555,of $500 goal,https://fundrazr.com/5iQjb,Zoe is going to Italy to sing with the Chorale!,9,U.S. Dollar
"Hey Family and Friends! As most of you know, I am currently attending  Northpoint Bible
  College to major in World Missions. This summer my internship for
  school is in Malawi, Africa.  While in Malawi, I will work in
  different churches and be speaking to many of the teens about God. I
  will also visit many poverty-stricken villages and orphanages during
  my stay to help in any way that I am needed. This trip will last two
  months. I will be leaving June 1,2014 and returning on August 1,2014. The cost of my trip will be about $5,000. As you know that is a lot
  to raise in a few months. If you could in any way donate to my trip, I
  would greatly appreciate whatever amount God lays on
  your heart. I will need to raise all my funds by May of 2014 in order
  to pay for airline tickets and other items.You can donate here online
  or make checks payable to Love and Truth Community Church. On the
  check please indicate that it is for my Malawi trip. If you feel more
  comfortable to send me a check personally, you can also do that. My address is: Victoria Hebert Northpoint Bible College 320 South Main Street Haverhill, Ma 01835 If you are unable to donate, I ask that you will join with me in
  prayer that God will continue to prepare me for this trip and will
  bless my efforts to reach the people of Africa. I am excited to see
  how God provides for me as I know it will be a testimony of God’s love
  and provision that I will never forget. Whether you feel led to
  contribute financially, through prayer, or both, all of your support
  is appreciated. Thank you and God Bless! :) Victoria Hebert",670,of $5k goal,https://fundrazr.com/ciK40,Malawi Internship!,4,U.S. Dollar

  thought it would that includes several ferries diesel and road

  steeped in economic woe , women in poverty often have
  few resources to support themselves and their families. By paying fair
  wages in an area with little formal employment, our program empowers
  mothers to invest in their future and the future of their families.
  Madres employs both Dominican and Haitian women, building solidarity
  between two cultures that have endured centuries of mistrust stemming

"Maggie is my 12 year old sister who is currently enrolled in
  Riverside Middle School at grade 7. She is trying to raise money to be
  able to fulfill a recommendation she received. Earlier in the school year, Maggie was nominated to be an
  International Student Ambassador through People to People by her
  English teacher. She is an amazingly bright student who strives to do
  her best academically. She has gotten nothing less than all A Honor
  Roll for the past year, and never less than A-B Honor Roll in her
  entire school career. My sister is also very active in school, being
  involved in multiple extra curricular activities. She is very active
  in Softball, and was trained as shortstop and pitcher last year.
  Maggie has also been involved in Girl Scouts for the past 8
  consecutive years, and has now reached the title of a Second Year
  Cadet. She also helps with the younger troops, coaching and
  encouraging younger girls, one day a week. The program Maggie was recommended for is People to People's Student
  Ambassador Program. This certain program is titled Mediterranean
  Traditions. The destination is to Italy, France, and Spain for 19
  days. They will be uncovering an ancient history and discover
  modern-day wonders on a unique journey to Italy, France, and Spain.
  Maggie will be returning home enriched by unique experiences in these
  amazing countries—and with a new understanding of this incredible part

"Have you ever wanted to visit Australia? Everyone is fascinated by the Sunburnt Country. It is one of the most
  rugged, awe-inspiring, and jaw-droppingly beautiful countries in the
  world. With thousands of plants and animals you can't find anywhere
  else, you'd think you were in a different world! Next week, I will be in Melbourne Australia to film a travel
  documentary. This documentary will be made available on vimeo.com for
  anyone and everyone to watch as they please. Why? I LOVE Australia and want to share my love for it
  with everyone. Why Melbourne? Somewhere around 80% of the U.S. population is only familiar with
  Sydney.  Yet every year, hundreds of thousands of people from all over
  the globe make a pilgrimage a destination in Australia other than
  Sydney.  Melbourne is Australia's second-largest city, and has a
  wealth of amazing and unique history that hardly anyone this side of
  the Pacific knows about.  St. Kilda, Federation Square, The Great
  Ocean Road, Twelve Apostles, Phillip Island Penguin Parade, the gold
  mining town of Walhalla... I plan on covering all of those
  destinations in the film, and more if possible. What do I need? I already have all of the filming equipment, airfare, and a campervan
  (motorhome). But I REALLY need your help with some
  expenses while I am there so I can make this the best documentary I
  possibly can. Food, petrol (gasoline!), and coffee add up QUICK.
  I want to capture as much as possible without going broke. What's the big deal? I only have 6 days in Melbourne to do this to make it AWESOME. I can
  only afford one week off from work to do this, and it means the world
  to me. I don't want to come home a failure. I want to make an awesome
  film and share my amazing experiences with you and the world! Why Australia? I'm an Australian-American born and raised in the US.  My father and
  his family migrated from Perth, Western Australia in 1969.  Sadly, I
  never met him, and never will.  He passed away 14 years ago, and since
  young love did not work in his favor, I grew up without him.  He means
  so much to me from what I know of him, and this missing piece of my
  life is what drives my passion and love for Australia and everything
  in it. Am I any good? I am not a professional film maker.  I am a hobbyist videographer
  with a large collection of good tools (camera, lenses, audio
  equipment, steadicam, miscellaneous rigs...).  I have been a
  photographer for over 10 years, and I have 12+ years work history in
  digital media, so I promise that I know how to make something that does NOT suck. Everyone tells me I have a voice for the radio. It's true.  Ever since I could shave I have been told that my voice
  is deep, strong, and pleasant to listen to.  This is not my opinion,
  but the words of many colleagues, friends, and family.  I also feel
  that I can write reasonably well.  I will work hard to make the dialog
  for the documentary useful, entertaining, and easy on the ears. Please check out my blog and my Facebook page. My blog is at http://asunburntcountry.com , and my Facebook page
  is at http://www.facebook.com/asunburntcountry ""But it's so young. You have hardly done anything!"" All of the planning for this crazy adventure I'm going on is what has
  been keeping me from writing more and publishing more content on my
  blog and Facebook page.  I have already made such a massive financial
  commitment to this project, I will not back down or let it die without
  one hell of a fight. This is going to be awesome! I promise you will not regret it.  Please donate to my cause and help

  treatment with chemotherapy in an effort to stop growth of the tumor.
  If the tumor continues to grow, she will likely require surgery to
  prevent severe spinal cord compression and paralysis. She may also
  require additional radiation in the future to help control this tumor. Due to the nature of intensive treatment involved with medical and

"Children in Asia are sold into the sex slavery industry as young as 4

"Hello , and thanks for reading! My name is Silje,
  and I would like your help with making this June the
  best ever for my best friend, Irene. This year marks the 10-year anniversary for the friendship of a
  lifetime – in April 2004, Irene and I got to know each other after our
  two classes went on a joint study trip to Barcelona. From then on, we
  became best friends and close enough that we feel like sisters. Our
  friendship has lasted through everything life has thrown at it for the
  last 10 years, and we feel it’s only appropriate to celebrate it
  properly, which is why we’ve decided to do so in the city that
  introduced us to each other. (Hover your mouse over the
  picture(s) for a description!) Since 2004, our love for Barcelona has only grown. In 2010, we had
  the chance to go back for a week to celebrate Irene’s 24th birthday
  (and we'll actually celebrate my 28th this time!), and we spent the
  week wandering all over the city, exploring vigorously. In 2011, Irene started getting ill. Her health was deteriorating
  rapidly, and where she a year earlier had been up to walking around a
  big city all day long, she suddenly had trouble walking down the
  stairs. In 2012, she was finally diagnosed with fibromyalgia, which
  she had suspected for a while. Her active life with her newfound love for the Red Cross had to be
  put on ice, as she was too fatigued and in too much pain to be able to
  help out when it was needed. This crushed her, and for a long time it
  was all she could do to get out of bed in the morning. Joining her
  friends for a movie or going shopping would exhaust her to the point
  of tears. Luckily, her wonderful doctor got her started on the right
  medications and little by little, the pain started to recede. In 2013, she started exercising and adjusted her diet, and as a
  result she could reduce her medication dosages. Progress is a
  beautiful thing! She’s still ill, though - still in pain (and has all
  the other symptoms fibromyalgia causes), although
  some days are definitely worse than others. What helps immensely with
  her pain is warmth, and the climate in Spain will most likely be
  perfect for her, which is another reason for us to go to a warmer
  country than Norway for our anniversary trip. The hope is that she
  will be in significantly less pain for the 15 days we’re there, which
  in itself will be a vacation for her. Now, you may recognise Irene from her own FundRazr campaign , «Help a chronic illness survivor get her
  driver’s license», and now you’re possibly thinking «Well, shouldn’t
  you rather use any money raised here for her license instead of a
  vacation?» The answer is both yes and no. I’ve started
  this separate campaign (actually without Irene’s knowledge, it's a
  surprise!) because I want this vacation to be the best one we
  can possibly have. It’ll be a long, long time before we can go on a
  trip together again, with Irene’s savings going towards her license
  and me being a student without a job. We have saved up some money for this trip, and are still saving on
  the side, as much as we can (though with Irene setting aside most of
  her money for her driver’s license, it’s not much). The apartment
  we’ll be staying in is already paid, as are the plane tickets, but
  because life is unpredictable, we’re now having trouble with money for
  food, transportation, etc. A month ago, my car broke down, and I had to spend nearly all the
  money I’d saved up for our trip to fix it. Now it's full of water, and
  further work is needed to make it waterproof (not a thing I ever
  thought I'd say about a car ). Irene’s savings are not nearly
  enough to support the two of us for 15 days, and as she’s unable to
  work, I’ve now been applying for part time jobs and summer jobs. The
  hope is that I can be able to save up more before we leave on June
  10th – and this is where you come in. I’m not asking for you to cover all our expenses, of course. I will
  do my best to save up what I need to cover basic stuff, but I need
  help making this the trip of a lifetime! With your help, we’ll be able
  to afford to visit the sights and hopefully go on a day trip to
  Montserrat, where we’ve never been and really would love to visit. My
  goal is to make this trip an unforgettable one for Irene, because she
  deserves it so, so much after everything life has thrown at her. If I should be so lucky that I raise more money than I’ve
  asked for, all of the excess will be given to Irene’s license
  campaign . I will do so publicly with my own account so everyone
  can see where their money end up, of course! And on that note – I will
  be active here during my campaign’s runtime, updating, thanking you
  and so on, and during our stay in Barcelona I will be blogging daily
  for those who want to follow us. I'll give you a link to the blog
  before we leave. I don’t know what else to offer – maybe postcards if
  anyone is interested in getting one? Let me know! :) Any donations will help us immensely, and I thank you in advance for
  your kindness. If you could also spread the word, that would be wonderful. Thank you all so much!","1,165",of $1.5k goal,https://fundrazr.com/fiuq9,Help me make our anniversary trip awesome!,17,U.S. Dollar

  include Bob Dylan, Robert Johnson, Son House, Mose Allison and Sam Cooke. Kurt A. and Jeremy are looking for like-minded partners to help
  offset some of the looming costs for this journey of discovery.  Help

"If you know Sky, you know that she's usually singing, dancing or
  being creative rather than playing with toys. Year after year, she
  gratefully recieves gifts that seem like a lot of fun, but in reality,
  pile up and are either regifted or held on to because they ""were
  really nice presents"", and she feels bad getting rid of them,
  even if to make more room. For several years now, Sky has been wanting to get on a
  plane and take her first trip somewhere. I thought, what more magical
  of a trip could she take for her first, than to vacation in
  Disneyland?!  As she will be turning 8 years old this year, I thought
  that she is just the right age to enjoy something like that. We (Sky and I) agreed that this year for her birthday, nothing would
  be appreciated more than contributions towards this magical
  opportunity. She truely does not want and can't even think of any toys
  or gifts she's interested in. She already has so much, and would love
  to have this experience more than anything. I am the queen of
  budgeting, so we will make this trip as affordable as possible. If I
  can afford it, I'm also trying to bring a very good friend of ours so
  that I have another adult on the trip, but funds raised here will be
  first and foremost for me to get Sky there. Just because we don't want presents, doesn't mean we don't want to
  party...fear not...there WILL be a Disney themed party for Sky on her
  birthday (May 20th) with cake and good fun times just as usual. Also,
  the trip is planned for October 2nd and we will return October 5th. So...if you honestly want to know what Sky wants for her birthday
  this year...this is it! Spread the word, don't feel you have to donate
  more than you'd spend on a toy from the store, and let's make this
  magical dream come true for our little rock and roll princess!

"Why we are excited about this opportunity and how it will enrich our community Being invited to represent mid Missouri at Slow Food's Terra Madre
  and Salone del Gusto conference in Italy is a once-in-a-lifetime
  opportunity. We will meet, eat and engage with people from throughout
  the world who are passionate about and committed to sustainable
  agriculture, cultural preservation and food with integrity. All the
  delegates, from more than 100 countries, will be there to represent
  the very best of what their countries' food systems have to offer. This is not only an honor for the three of us, but an opportunity for
  others to learn about mid Missouri through the connections we make and
  the lessons we share with fellow delegates. Upon return to Columbia,
  we'll be happy to pass along newly gained knowledge through community
  conversations and application of the best practices encountered. Who are we? The three delegates from Columbia are Lisa Griffith, Carrie Hargrove
  and Jacob Knerr. Each represents a spoke in the wheel of Columbia’s
  constantly evolving Slow Food culture and sustainable agricultural scene. Lisa Griffith (in grey shirt) Lisa, who grew up on a diverse Pike County family farm, sought
  several careers before returning to her Missouri roots several years
  ago. Her work with non-profit organizations—particularly in her
  current position as outreach coordinator for the National Family Farm
  Coalition—has connected Lisa with many educators, activists,
  farmers/fishers and chefs. She is inspired by them to promote social
  justice and food sovereignty—the right of all peoples to determine
  their own resource, agricultural and food policies. Carrie Hargrove (with shovel) ​Carrie helped to create and has worked for the Columbia Center for
  Urban Agriculture (CCUA) for five years. The CCUA is a non-profit
  organization that teaches people how to garden. As its farm manager,
  Carrie works with many volunteers to grow beautiful, chemical-free
  produce that is sent to the Annie Fischer Food Pantry and Columbia
  Farmers Market. Her goal in life is to inspire all Columbia residents
  to love gardening and backyard food production as much as she does.​ Jacob Knerr (middle) Jacob is a Rock Bridge High School student with a serious culinary
  passion. Having grown up on farms in rural mid Missouri, Jacob knows
  that food connects us all, and that access to good, clean and fair
  food is important for everyone—a perspective he tries to share with
  his fellow students. He puts his passion into practice during culinary
  arts classes at the Columbia Area Career Center. He also works at The
  Wine Cellar & Bistro as a line chef and host. What we're asking from you Your support will help send three representatives from Columbia,
  Missouri, to the conference in Turin, Italy. In return, we'll share
  Columbia’s vibrant Slow Food culture with international audiences and
  bring back knowledge gathered from throughout the world. Our conference admission, room and board, and transportation within
  Italy are provided. We need help covering the round-trip airfare costs
  between Columbia and Italy. Once we return, we'll be eager to share our experiences with our
  community, neighbors, co-workers, friends and families. All
  contributors will be invited to a presentation of our travels upon our
  return, and each one will receive a thoughtful “thank you” gift that
  represents our experiences in Italy. What is Slow Food? Slow Food is a non-profit, grassroots membership organization that
  was founded in Italy in 1986 as a response to fast food and fast-food
  culture. It has grown into an international organization with more
  than 150,000 members in 150 countries. Slow Food strives to link the
  pleasures of the table with a commitment to protect the community,
  culture, knowledge and environment that make this pleasure possible. Columbia has a very active Slow Food chapter called Slow Food Katy
  Trail, founded in 2003. In addition, the city has a robust community
  of support for sustainable agriculture, good food and independent,
  local family farmers. It is a reflection of this dynamic culture that

  guys! We hit the goal and with SO MANY days to spare, and a bunch of
  money left over! Thank you all SO MUCH!! Feel free to keep
  donating if you guys want to! The money's still going towards Canada,
  it'll just still be used as sort of a back up in case anything goes
  wrong. You never know, y'know? But still. Thank you all so much for this. Really. It's VERY
  appreciated. Please keep an eye on the update section below for
  Chase's current status, with possibly photos? I'll see if I can worm
  them out of him, haha. But. Again. Can't say it enough. Thank you all SO MUCH!! Hi. I'm Anastasia, Ana, or as I'm known on the internet,
  Azurite/Sonic. I'm friends with an amazing individual and have been
  for the last few years, and I'm here on FundRazr on his behalf.  You
  might know us both from our Bluedudewithatude Sonic the Hedgehog and
  doceggman Doctor Eggman roleplay blogs. His name is Chase Gerald Mason Harston, and he's in an
    incredibly horrific situation. From the first day
    we met, I've been quickly made aware of his abusive home
  life. His mom was an irresponcible money-grubbing alchoholic
  who married his abusive anger-issue ridden step-father. The two of
  them are just the tip of the iceberg of his selfish family members
  that have been making his life a living hell for even longer than I've
  been aware of it, and it came to a head just a few weeks ago. He's put up with his step-father's physical attacks, his mother
    drinking ""because of him"", and his mom also begging for
    money from him and never paying him back. This is the family
  that took every effort he had to keep it together for years and
  crushed it swiftly and quickly for a very long time. And after all of
  his attempts (at least 4 or 5) to keep this family together, one in
  particular being a fundraiser like this one, his mother
    stopped paying the mortage, leading the family to be kicked out of
    their home early this month. She had the money; she kept it for herself. Now that they're out of the hellhole, they've left him for
    dead completely. My best friend Stephanie AKA Tails has helped support him in this
    dark hour, and currently he's on the money she's given him to stay stable. But it'll run out soon enough, and if he doesn't get help by
    November, he'll be homeless. There's a chance, though. But he can't do it alone. One of the forms of abuse was that Chase had a goal all these years. To get out of the limbo this family put him in and move to
    Canada to be with his girlfriend, Mariah. He's earned the money
  to visit her at least 3 times over, to have a situation like the
  mortgage come up, or have his mother scam him out of his money. His
  step-father would constantly berrate him about her; saying she
  ""wasn't real"". His entire family has kept him from her for
  years. But now, she's his only chance. This FundRazr campain is for one thing, and one thing only. To get him to Canada. The goal is at least one
  One-Way ticket there, but ANYTHING helps, and anything's
  appreciated. Anything at all. He's worked it out with Mariah AKA
  Mai and will stay with her upon imigrating to the country ASAP. All of
  the funds will be sent directly to his PayPal. Sorry to say that this FundRazr campaign doesn't have any rewards
  attatched, since I'm not exactly the most talented person on the
  planet, BUT my best friend Steph/Tails has opened up
    commissions on Chase's behalf for really cheap! All
  proceeds of the commissions go towards helping him, so go have a look at her prices if
    you're interested! Another one of Chase's friends has done
    the same thing, go check out her prices, too! Please donate to help my friend. He's stuck in the worst situation
  he's ever been in. And this really is his only hope right now. - Anastasia ""Azurite/Sonic"" G.",881,of $635 goal,https://fundrazr.com/3rRH8,Canada or Bust,19,U.S. Dollar

"Dear Friends and Family, I hope this letter finds you well. I
  have recently graduated from The College of William and Mary with a
  Major in Chinese, and a Minor in Process Management and Consulting.
  I'm not quite sure what God would have me do with either of these, if
  anything, but for a long time now my focus has been on teaching for a
  year in China in order grow my skillset and person. To that end, most
  of my Senior Year was dedicated to paying the fee for a great program
  that I found online (US Chinese Culture Center), which would not only
  provide me with TESL Certification, but also with housing and a
  monthly stipend. I am happy to say that I was blessed to be able pay
  the fee in full. However, I have reached one last obstacle to
  overcome, which is the plane ticket. It should be around $1000-1200
  for a departure in late August, which would normally not be an issue
  with the job I currently have. However, recent familial circumstances
  have caused me to turn my finances to other priorities. I am currently
  only able to put around $400 to the ticket and am working as much as I
  can to come up with the rest, yet my financial priorities are split
  between China and familial support. For these reasons, I ask first and
  foremost for your prayers that God's will be done. Though undoubtedly
  a great opportunity, a year in China might not be His will, but
  secondly, if you feel so inclined, a financial contribution would be
  greatly appreciated. However as in everything, do as you believe you
  are called by God, and thank you for support. God bless.",951,of $650 goal,https://fundrazr.com/bodQf,Help me teach English in China,10,U.S. Dollar
"PARA ESPAÑOL FAVOR DE LEER MAS ABAJO **PLEASE CLICK HERE (OR ABOVE) TO WATCH A
    VIDEO OF EDUARDO SALMERON - TRANSCRIPT BELOW** Bachillerato Integral de Cd Juarez (BIJ) is initiating a campaign to
  raise funds to bring Eduardo Salmeron (principal of BIJ) and one
  student, to New York City to witness Theater Mitu’s production of
  JUÁREZ: A DOCUMENTARY MYTHOLOGY while engaging with the audience.
  Theater Mitu will host a talk back with Eduardo Salmeron, a BIJ
  student, and Artistic Director Rubén Polendo after the October 4th 8pm
  Show at Off-Broadway’s Rattlestick Playwrights Theater. BIJ was an
  integral partner in the development of JUÁREZ: A DOCUMENTARY MYTHOLOGY
  over a period of three years in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Theater Mitu
  company members have given masterclasses at BIJ and continue to have
  an ongoing commitment in the success of BIJ and its students. Why do you believe in this piece? Because this piece is about us from an outside perspective, is not us
  telling our own story. Also because is a story that surfaced from a
  collection of voices and pieces that were intertwined and interpreted
  by Mitu. Without doubt is bizarre but at the same time very important,
  to see yourself through the eyes of others. Why do you want to come to NY? To see the reaction of people …I would like to see, to know what
    the piece stirs up in them, what it makes them think, to find out
    what was the audience perspective of our city and what they think
    after the piece. I would like to know if the play will bring the
    audience ""closer"" to us or if it confuses them. We have a
    lot of expectations about going to New York a lot of expectation to
    watch the play and really just to be there. Why is this campaign important to BIJ? Three students and the principal from BIJ were interviewed, and
    without doubt we are part of those multiple voices that were used.
    In one way or another our stories are intertwined with the rest of
    the stories, and in a way it has something to do with us. Is
    important for people to know that after the hard times, we continue
    to walk together in our city, that we continue to do stuff, that
    students keep going to school, and that above all there is a lot of hope. ABOUT THEATER MITU AND THE PRODUCTION: Theater Mitu supports Bachillerato Integral de Ciudad Juárez (BIJ) on
  their FundRazer Campagin as an effort to galvanize its audience for
  the New York City production of JUÁREZ: A DOCUMENTARY MYTHOLOGY by
  helping to raise funds for the Principal of BIJ, Eduardo Salmeron and
  one of his students, who were instrumental to the research,
  development and creation of the piece. This production premiered in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico and has toured to
  El Paso, Texas; The NACL Theatre in Highland Lake, NY; Rattlestick
  Playwrights Theater in New York City; Abu Dhabi in the UAE; and
  Beirut, Lebanon. And will continue to tour throughout the next two
  years in the USA and abroad. More than two years in development. Over 200 hours of interview
  footage. Hundreds of conversations. Theater Mitu creates an artful

  han impartido clases magistrales en BIJ y siguen teniendo un
  compromiso continuo con el éxito de BIJ y sus alumnos. Porque crees en esta pieza? Porque se trata de nosotros desde la perspectiva de los de
    ""afuera"". No somos nosotros mismos contando nuestra
    historia. Esta hecha a partir de multiples voces y cuyos pedazos
    fueron tejidos e interpretados por Mitu. Sin duda es extrano y a la
    vez muy importante, el percibirte a traves de otros ojos. Porque quieres venir a NY? Para ver la reaccion de la gente a partir de la obra que estan
    viendo. Saber que les provoca, que les hace pensar, cual era su
    perspectiva acerca de nuestra ciudad y como nos ven. Tratar de
    entender si la obra los ""acerca"" a nosotros o los
    confunde. Tenemos mucha expectativa por ver una vez la obra y
    emopcion por estar alla. Porque esta campaña es importante para BIJ? 3 alumnos de Bij y el director fueron entrevistados y son parte de
    esas multiples voces, de alguna manera u otra esas historias
    entrelazadas tienen que ver con nosotros. Es importante que la gente
    sepa que despues de los tiempos dificiles seguimos caminando como
    ciudad , que seguimos haciendo cosas, que los alumnos siguen llendo
    a la escuela y que hay mucha esperanza. Theater Mitu apoya al Bachillerato Integral de Cd. Juárez (BIJ) en su

"On April 4th 2015, We ,a group of Insane Backpackers from all across
  the globe, will take part in an epic adventure called the Rickshaw Run
  in order to raise as much money as possible for their chosen Charities. We will Race an Indian Rickshaw (Tuk-Tuk) 3500km across India from
  Jaislamer to Shillong in Bangladesh in 16 Days across some of the
  worst road conditions on the planet all in the name of charity along
  side 200 other teams. With No set route, No back-up, No way of knowing
  if we're going to make it. The only certainty is that we will get
  lost, we will get stuck ,we will break down and it will definately be challenging. If you are unsure of what a rickshaw is here is the offical
  description by the Rickshaw run team... ''If God had made machines he probably wouldn't have bothered with
    a Rickshaw. But as with so many other things he would have been
    wrong. Essentially, it's not a very good idea. It's not very fast,
    it smells, it falls over when you go round corners, it breaks downs
    more often than an emo teenager and a days driving feels like you've
    been kicked up the arse by an elephant. But somehow all this makes
    them better.'' So far, we have 9 people in our team; with this in mind everyone has
  a charity close to their hearts so we have chosen 4 charities so far
  to support. 1- Sea shepherd, a marine conservation organization. 2-Changing stories, helping underprivileged children in El salvador. 3-Alzheimer's society, helping fight Alzheimer's. 4-The MS Therapy Centre Oxford, supporting MS patients. On top of this the money we as idividuals will pay will go towards
  saving hecters of Rainforest in the Amazon Jungle Through the Cool

"Hi Everyone! Please see my original post below in italics about how this page came
  to be. I have since been in touch with Dana and he is extremely grateful for
  all of your contributions! Follow his story on Facebook - it is
  nothing short of inspiring.  Let's keep the donations coming - they
  really do make a difference to this incredible journey across the
  Trans Canada Trail!! Maury & Family :) Check out his Facebook page here: https://www.facebook.com/thegreathike/info See where Dana is right now - LIVE: https://share.delorme.com/DanaMeise My name is Maury - and truth be told I've never met Dana Meise -
    but I sure feel as though I have. I hope he doesn't mind I stole his
    picture from his public Facebook page!  100% disclosure - Dana does
    NOT know I'm doing this. My wife heard his story on CBC with Stuart McLean and told me all
    about him.  My first reaction was to quietly nod and passively agree
    that ""Yes, sounds interesting.  Hiking the Trans Canada Trail.
     Sounds crazy"".  I believe my exact words were ""that's
    insane"".  And I quickly shuffled his story to the back of my
    mind next to the dusty file folder containing my intense love for
    Better Homes and Gardens. Yes that was sarcasm. The fact is - I completely dismissed Dana and his quest. Then something happened.  I began to think what I would tell my
    children someday if they asked about such a man and his hike.  The
    truth is - something amazing is happening here.  7 years later he is
    still hiking.  Yes - 7 years.  Dana has decided this is what he
    needs to do.  He has given himself to his journey 100%.  No excuses
    and no regrets and no fear of what could happen.  We could all learn
    from this - I know I sure could. Check out his Facebook page here: https://www.facebook.com/thegreathike/info See where Dana is right now - LIVE: https://share.delorme.com/DanaMeise Since being on CBC he has gained around 3500 new followers - I
    figure if every one of those people is willing to donate $1 - we can
    help him finish out his trek with a hotel night or two ""in his
    back pocket"" so to speak. Let's help Dana Complete His Journey. Maury. PS - 100% of all funds collected will go straight to Dana - I have
    not figured out the logistics - I'm sitting at my kitchen table
    letting my idea come to life.  It will be entirely up to him how
    these funds are spent (so if you don't want him to buy himself a
    beer... you might not want to donate).  With any luck we can help
    him finish his trip and get a book published - there is a powerful
    story here that we can all learn from which should be shared in print! Quote from Dana's Facebook Page: ""A 24,000k hike on the TransCanadaTrail - 18,000k done.

      worlds longest trail at 24,000km's and stretches to all three of
      Canada's Oceans the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic, passing through
      over a 1000 communities... As of Dec 17th/2013 I became the first person to hike across

  2013.  Now, we are moving to America to be closer to my family so that
  we can try to move forward with our lives.  The price to ship a dog,

  ship him to the states started at £1400 and once they found out he was

"Hi Everyone, I wanted to try and reach out to some of you that I
  think might be able to give a couple of pounds towards a person and
  his family whom I know and respect as a man. Last week my father passed away and I have come to learn that as one
  man has left the earth which was a father to me ' by name term' only. 
  Anther man is still on this earth who is a great father. I have trekked with Deu Chandra now twice, and met all his family.
  They all live in a small town in Nepal in Pokara. I have been to his
  house, eaten in there, spent time with his family and felt so
  welcomed. They live so simple and Deu does his absolute best as the
  man of the house to go out and find work in the harsh environment that
  is trekking. Deu's wife looks after the children and cant work as the
  'caste' system is so rife in Nepal that you have to be viewed as being
  in a certain category to be even able to find any sort of decent work. Deu is a lovely warm , kind and gentle man that just wants to be a
  good father to his children, everything that a father should be in
  this world we live in. My message is simply this, I am going to donate some money to Deu,
  and I hope you can spare some too. Even the price of a coffee or a
  sandwich, or 1 drink of the many i'm sure we are going to spend over
  this festive time. Money of which thi well deserved father, can spend money on his
  family, as I know he will do. To put things into perspective here are some figures. £10-15 is roughly a daily amount that he can earn for trekking 8-9
    hours in the freezing snow, helping us western lot up a hill . £40  pays his bills for about a third of the year....if not more £3 is the average cost of feeling his family for a few days in Pokara Please give whatever you can...... it is Christmas, and it should be
  a time that familys enjoy each others company, and i'm sure they will,
  even though they have no heating ! This year maybe he can sleep a bit easier at night with a little
  comfort blanket we can give him ....with a little extra money ... Thank you for the time you have taken to read this..... ** There are more pictures in the updates tab on the page ** He really is a great Father, to his children ! He tries his absolute
  best for his family. It's not easy trekking up mountains constantly

"In 2014 I self funded an attempt to achieve a life's dream of
  stepping foot on to the highest point on Earth. At the end of March I
  left my hometown of Hartlepool in the UK and travelled to Nepal, where
  I then trekked for 19 days to reach Mount Everest, the world's highest
  mountain. I was just hours away from the mountain and poised to begin
  the climb when a huge ice avalance came crashing down directly on to
  the climbing route. Unfortunately 16 sherpas were tragically killed in
  what became the worst and most fatal accident in the history of
  Everest climbing. This avalance ended all climbing on the mountain for 2014. I have vowed to return and give the climb one last shot but that all
  depends on whether I am able to get the funds together to pay the
  expedition fees for the 2nd year running. There are just 3 months to go now till departure from the UK for
  possibly one last chance to climb on Everest. After I travelled out to
  Everest in April 2014 after several years of tireless fundraising I
  never stepped foot on the mountain due to the deadliest single
  incident in the mountain's history on April 18th. Over the next 10 weeks I need to raise around £10,000 to take my
  place back on the team heading out to Nepal. Two years ago I had just 90 followers on this page and no way
  of raising the funds to reach the mountain. Today I have over 10,700
  likes, a failed attempt under my belt and a succesful brand of Everest
  themed gear to hopefully give me one more chance. No matter whether I succeed or fail I am proud of what I have
  achieved and how far I have come towards the achievement of a 20 year

"Most of you know Tyler and the injuries he incurred from his
  accident. For those of you that do not know Tyler he is an amazing boy
  that was in an unfortunate car accident December 10th, 2013. He died three times at the scene of the accident and doctors
    were skeptical he would make it through the night. He made
  it through that night, and several months later he fought his way home
  from the hospital. Then doctors told us he would never breath again on
  his own. He proved them wrong yet again, and when he had a follow up
  appointment last September he was taken off ventilator support. Last week we took Tyler for an evaluation with the hopes to get him
  into vigorous day therapy. Unfortunately his evaluating doctor left us
  discouraged. By barely assessing him she was quick to say this
  wouldn’t be right program for him. In this particular instance, and
  with others in the past, I feel the doctor did not have Tyler's best
  interests and needs in mind and this only makes me want to prove her
  wrong also. He has proven doctors wrong in the past and I can
    see the fight in his eyes. I know his strengths and see how
  far he is willing to go and I won't let one evaluation limit my
  child's options. I have to take him to constant therapy and I won't
  settle for less. He has outgrown most of his loaner equipment and the insurance
  company has failed to actually provide him with the proper supplies
  that he needs to get around and to do his home therapies with. I have looked for a used wheelchair accessible vehicle but
    they are very expensive . Even with 100k miles and 10 years
  old the cost is still $20,000 at best. I have found some private
  sellers that would be willing to negotiate but it's still far out of
  my reach. To paint a clearer picture I am currently picking Tyler up
  out of his wheel chair and transporting him into my truck, this
  process wasn’t so bad when he was shorter and 40 pounds lighter. At
  this point, it has gotten very uncomfortable for him to be transported
  this way. We have had a fundraiser in the past for Tyler and it was very
  helpful but his medical needs are ongoing and the only way I can put
  that to a halt is to make sure he gets all the therapy he can get. I
  don’t like asking for handouts, but I need to know I did everything I
  could possibly do to care for my son. Thank you all so much

"Greetings Family, Friends, and Strangers! Exciting times are ahead as I continue my education
  towards a Doctoral Degree in Physical Therapy at Grand Valley State
  University. Along my academic journey is the opportunity to share the
  knowledge and skills I’ve gained with a population of people that so
  desperately need up-to-date healthcare services and provisions. It is
  my hope that, through your compassion and generosity, my trip to
  Zacapa, Guatemala can happen, and these people who cannot otherwise
  afford proper physical therapy may have the access and quality they deserve. My GVSU crew will be working with Hearts in Motion.
  Physical Therapists first travelled to Guatemala with Hearts in Motion
  in 2002. At that time, the “therapy clinic” consisted of a slotted
  park bench within the public health department. Braces were made by
  recycling parts of old braces, softening the plastic by hot water
  heated over an open fire. Thanks to Hearts in Motion, residents of Zacapa, Guatemala
  and the surrounding communities are now able to receive therapy
  services in a fully equipped, free standing rehabilitation center. The
  Kevin O’Halloran Rehabilitation Center opened in 2004. Services are
  provided by a full time Guatemalan Physical Therapist, Esvin Monzon,
  at no charge. In 2011, over 210 people received therapy at this facility. Through your contributions I hope to assist in this effort,
  which will be focused on reaching people who are unable to leave their
  homes, working with children with disabilities, and assisting the
  clinic with the overwhelming number of patients they see daily. The
  trip is being funded entirely through donations and other fundraising
  initiatives put together by my classmates joining me. We will be
  sending therapy supplies ahead of us prior to our trip as well as
  bringing some with us. Every penny and item collected will be used to
  directly benefit our service to Guatemala. It is with great excitement that I prepare for this
  opportunity to serve and I humbly, yet eagerly, ask that you join me.
  Your support in the form of financial aid, prayer, or any other medium
  will be greatly appreciated. Please feel free to contact me if you
  have any questions or would like more information about the
  organization or our work in Guatemala. Additional information about
  Hearts in Motion can be found on their website at http://heartsinmotion.org/ ! My email address is waughz@mail.gvsu.edu . If you
  are not comfortable using this site to contribute, I can give you my
  personal address in which to send your donations. Please feel free to share (on this page or privately) any
  stories you have regarding your road to recovery, the impact of health
  and wellness on your life (or someone you know), or the importance and
  need for service in disadvantaged areas. I'd love to learn more about
  each of you and your perspectives towards health and wellness, as it
  is what serves as an inspiration to me to continue along this amazing journey. Thank YOU all, for it is all of YOU that will make this

  walk, to jump, to eat, to clothe, and to sleep, knowing that their
  bodies will be able to once more perform the tasks they passionately

  and spending money for myself to travel and eat. Any and all donations
  towards this trip by friends or family is greatly appreciated, and if you decide to donate, I plan on giving you something back
    in return! (Details of the perks are on the right side of
  the page) During my stay, I plan to travel throughout as much of Austria and
  Germany as I can during my free time, and my program already includes
  trips to south Tirol as well as a few other local Austrian landmarks.
  I will also have the opportunity of crossing off one of the biggest
  tasks on my life-long bucket list when I snowboard in the Alps! The

"I suppose this is a little unorthadox but here I am, setting up
  something to raise funds. Why? Because I need to raise some money to
  fulfill a lifelong dream. I want to get to Scotland for a vacation,
  for research, to meet family I've never met and see the family
  castle...to see if this homesickness for a place I've never even been
  before can be fixed or if it's time I started seriously looking into
  moving. But I can't get over there on my own. I live on a very limited income and it will not change unless my book
  suddenly takes off. See I can't work because I have some heart issues,
  one of them being a pulmonary aneurysm. It's pretty rare and can be
  serious but not something I can have surgery on at this point. It's
  too close to my heart to justify the risk of the surgery and it hasn't
  gotten all that much bigger or moved since it was discovered six years
  ago. Or seven? I've lost count. Anyway! Because I'm not allowed to
  work I literally live month to month on disability and have no room
  for saving. Book sales have helped but everything I've made from it is
  being flipped to go into promotional stuff for signings and
  whathaveyou. It's very frustrating. I never expected to become the
  next JK Rowling but I was hoping to make at least enough to get me to
  Scotland. And it hasn't happened. So I'm turning to the internets!

  tomorrow, could be next year, could be when I'm 80. And I don't want
  to sit here pining away and lamenting the fact that I am stuck here. I am not stuck. I have the power to change my life and I am

  After applying for this amazing journey I quickly added how much I
  could possibly save to complete the trip. Unfortunately with full time
  studying and only casual work it makes it really difficult to save he
  desired amount. The flights cost $1880 and the trip its self cost

"Hi. I'm James, a London-based filmmaker. For the past few years, I've
  been lucky enough to be given the opportunity to write and direct
  several low-budget short films. All have been made by a creative team
  of incredibly enthusiastic and talented people, working unpaid, and
  generously donating their time and extensive skills for their love of
  the work and belief in the projects. The latest of which, For My Next Trick , is to
  receive its world premiere at the prestigious HollyShorts film
  festival in Los Angeles next month. This is exciting! It was a film
  that I wrote, inspired by a young actress that would become its star,
  and that I found incredibly creatively rewarding, pushing myself as a
  director, and stretching the budget to its limits. However, as thrilling as it is, this silver lining has a cloud. Los
  Angeles is a very long way from my base in London, and flying there is
  not cheap... particularly with the screening only a few weeks away. I
  would dearly love to be able to make the premiere of a film I created,
  and represent not only myself, but also the immensely talented cast
  and crew that made it happen. Yes, this is far from a noble cause. I appreciate it could be seen as
  somewhat of a selfish request, and in many ways, I'm not sure if I'm
  expecting anyone to actually help.... but then I thought ""What
  the Hell!"" - the only thing that asking for this hurts, is my pride. Flights from London to Los Angeles, at this time of year, and so
  close to the travel date, cost an agonising £1,000 +.

"Hi my name is Antonio, I have a 3 year old daughter named Riley
  Faith. She was born with congenital heart defects. We are getting
  ready to bring her in for a second heart surgery shortly after her 4th
  birthday on March 1st 2016. Before we go we would love to get to take
  her to Disney World so she can have a magical experience before she
  has to go in for her procedure. We unfortunately can not afford the
  trip and need some help with the cost. It would mean the world to our
  family if we could get to do this before we have to go through another
  heart surgery, and the recovery process. Riley loves frozen and all
  things Disney and has asked us about everyday for the last 3 months if
  we could go before she has to go to the Dr again. So again if you
  could help it would mean the world to us. So Riley's condition started before birth. When developing her heart
  did not develop the wall that it is supposed to have. Her aorta
  grew over her pulmonary artery. When Riley was 6 months old she
  had a procedure which we had her pulmonary artery disconnected
  from her heart and sewed over. Her heart no longer pumps blood
  into her lungs. The heart now pumps blood to the body and the
  veins in her head and upper arms bring it directly to the lungs
  to be oxygenated The second procedure she is having done will
  connect her veins from the lower extremities to the lungs and be
  disconnected from her heart. Riley loves Princess Ariel and Queen
  Elsa, and of course Mickey and Minnie Mouse. She told Cindi who
  is my wife and I that if we get to go the first thing that she
  wants to do is to go and sit with Ariel and have her tell her
  stories about the ocean. We want nothing more than to grant Riley
  this wish before we have to go to CHOP and relive a very scary
  time in all of our lives. Again if you can help my family will be
  forever thankful for your generosity. Thank you. Riley's next surgery is slated shortly after her fourth birthday. We
  do not have a solid date, as her condition can change at any time. She
  may not even get to be able to wait until her fourth birthday for her
  second and final surgery. Her prognosis is good for after the surgery.
  She will have some difficulty as she gets older, and needs to exert
  more energy. Her heart will not be as strong as a normal heart, and
  she will have take easier on herself. In talking with doctors during
  her birth and first round of surgery. They told me that the first
  round of patients who had this procdure done are now turing around 30
  years old and seem to be doing fine, but do need to see a cardiologist

"Let me introduce you to USAS! WE are United Students Against Sweatshops we started in 1997, we are
  student group who believe in solidarity and collective liberation.
  Existing for 18 years is a feat by itself for a student organization.
  All over the country our locals organize on our campuses to in
  solidarity with workers whether it means fighting for living wages for
  our campus workers to leveraging our position as students to ensure
  our schools hold contracts with sweatshop abusers, union busters and
  overall evil corporations. In all these years we have never accepted
  any corporate funding. WE are University of North Carolina--Greensboro students a
  working-class school, founded as a women's college. Most of us come
  from NC we attend UNCG because of its purported affordability, enjoy
  the diversity, want to stay close to home, among many other reasons.
  Along with being a university with mainly working-class students of
  color, we are in the South where the right wing attacks are draconian,
  the ""powers that be"" actively support these attacks--making
  organizing difficult. WE believe in community, a vibrant labor movement, student power and
  collective liberation. Resources are limited, time is a commodity but
  struggle is necessary for the life we all deserve. WE need your help! Building a new generation of organizers takes time
  but these regional conferences provide us the trainings we need to

"Hi my name is Rebeca. The reason I am asking for help is to get my daughter back into
  Canada. I am a single mother that pays everything on my own. My
  daughter's father got deported 2 years ago. He is refusing to help pay
  for her ticket back to canada saying hes bringing her when he comes
  back to canada if i fill out the proper papers as if she was a
  bribe.He lost his work truck, it got ruined from the river flood and
  is out of work. El Salvador is a high risk country and I cannot wait
  any longer to bring her back. I am begging of you to help even just a
  little, for you to help me bring her home safely not as some kind of
  bribe for citizenship, but as the little Canadian girl she is. Plane
  tickets are very expensive to go back and forth from there, let alone
  safely getting to the town in which she lives back to the airport. She
  is only 3 years of age and can't take the plane alone leaving  me no
  choice but paying  for my way down as well. If you have it in your
  heart to help, even just a little, it would mean the world to me to
  have my baby back where she belongs. It takes a village to raise a
  child, also to protect one. Thank you for your time. Be blessed.Canadain Embassy came up with a

"My brother John and I were always close. As his big sister, I did my
  best to protect him. When we found out that a rare, inherited
    cancer ran in our family and he was affected, I did everything I
    could do help him fight it. I found a research study which
  would provide the most current treatment options available, and helped
  him when he traveled to participate in it. He was determined to live
  to see his children grow up, and I was equally determined to do
  everything I could to help him with that. Sadly, he lost his fight with the disease earlier this year, but for
  the many people we met who suffer from the same disease, the fight
  continues. John always wanted to help those people as much as he
  wanted to get help himself, and we talked about forming an
  organization to make that happen. Even though he's gone, I
    want to keep that dream alive. Education and networking will be essential to the success of this
  effort. I'd like your help in attending a conference focused on this
  disease, to be held during the first week of November in Syracuse, New
  York. The money I raise will be used for the modest registration fee
  for the conference, round-trip airfare from the LA/Santa Barbara area,
  and for lodging while away. Should I not meet my goal, and thus be
  unable to attend, any money raised will be used as seed money for the

"For winter break, I will be going to Harbin, China, a place where
  they annually hold a life-size display of ice sculptures. There are
  many different attractions in Harbin, such as huge slides, castles of
  ice, and small shops to visit. I will be going to China with my
  exchange student, Stephen, where I will meet his family and live in
  his home for a short amount of time. The trip is not through an
  agency, so I will be free to go wherever I would like and do whatever
  Stephen and his family decide is best. We are planning on not only
  going to Harbin, but also to his home in Shanghai, where we will visit
  amusement parks and walk around the city. The vacation may also
  include trips to the beach or snow in different cities located
  throughout China. This trip will be a very fun vacation, but it is not only a time for
  me to relax.  I want to go to China so I can expand my vocabulary in
  Mandarin Chinese. I currently take Mandarin in school, and have
  excelled in it for the last three years. Now, I look forward to
  immersing myself in the culture so as to learn how to speak the
  language from thousands of native speakers. I hope to double-major in
  two languages in college, Mandarin and German, so this trip will help
  establish my Mandarin skills before I take on the ultimate challenge
  in college. My goal is to speak fluent Mandarin before I graduate from
  high school, and this trip will have a major impact on my achievement
  of this goal, and may also give me a better understanding of the
  different parts of the world. I have always been fascinated by other cultures and how people do
  things.  The history of even the youngest countries is amazing to me,
  but a country like China holds enough history to astonish me.  I would
  like to learn from the Chinese people about their ways of life and the
  history of their culture, and going to China is the only way to do so.
  I hope to see new, different ways of life, but also expect to see
  similarities between the Chinese culture and my own culture. I

  News, sent to draw others to Christ. For me, this pilgrimage begins the moment I say 'Yes' to the Lord. It
  begins the moment I start preparing myself emotionally, spiritually,

  dream vacation to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter Orlando
  Universal Studios. I was hoping to do this before May 18th 2016 so
  they could enjoy the exclusive Harry Potter Vacation.They have always
  dreamed of going there. They are such selfless people and I really
  believe they deserve to have this one dream come true for them. They
  have never been on a vacation and this would be the vacation of a
  lifetime for them. I would love to make their dreams come true myself
  but I cannot afford to because I am on a disability pension and unable
  to work due to pain caused by fibromyalgia. One of my daughters was
  diagnosed at the age of 3 of having Dandy Walker syndrome luckily she
  doesn't require a shunt but this condition does affect her speech and
  her balance this is why she is also on a disability pension and also
  unable to work. My other daughter does work every day, very long hours
  and she still barely makes enough to pay her rent, food, hydro etc.,
  let alone think about going on a vacation. This is why I feel they
  deserve to have at least one of their dreams come true. Any help of
  making this dream come true would be appreciated and mean the world to
  me, but I know it would be very much appreciated and would mean the

  amazing agent (Elke James) has booked great shows for us in Germany,
  Denmark and Netherlands!! See the schedule here:) We have secured 2 sponsors who are providing our gear: YAMAHA Germany is lending us sound equipment. Sennheiser is providing microphones. We tried really hard to find other sponsors to help cover tour
  expenses, but we haven't yet been able to do so. And unless we
  can magically teleport our Prius to Germany, we need your help! As amazing as touring is, it is very expensive. We have learned
  that the hard way (oh yes, the hard way!) from years
  of touring. This is our first time asking you for touring help
  because we won't be able to make this tour happen otherwise. The money raised will cover the following expenses: - travel
  to/from Germany for me & Nick - vehicle rental - vehicle
  insurance - printing & mailing of promotional materials
  (posters, flyers, etc) - some of the lodging costs (some venues
  are providing lodging) - fuel, tolls, parking fees,
  various transport costs, cellphone/European sim-card and data
  services, etc etc (Note: Fundrazr & paypal fees add up to 8%,
  which is still one of the lowest percentages among other fundraising
  sites ilke kickstarter or pledgemusic). The money we raise won't cover everything, but I am really
  hoping lots of people will come see us play and buy lots of CDs :) The money we make from the shows will go to paying all of our bills
  at home (house payment, car payment, health insurance, all of the
  regular bills, etc). And towards buying food while touring!!! Almost
  forgot the food :) If you can help by donating any amount, it will be a huge help!!! Every person who contributes to our tour fund will have access
    to all of our tour videos we are planning to make at every stop!!! We came up with donation levels/perks, but if you'd like a perk

"Over the years with our work for Modacity, we have prided ourselves
  in telling compelling stories about the people and ideas shaping our
  cities for the better, while also showing how our own family makes the
  most of living and moving in active ways. We believe cities can learn
  from one another, and strive to share lessons from our travels around
  the world, and inspire our peers with what is achievable. Very few places exemplify the positive effect that multi-modal
  planning has on its citizens than in The Netherlands. Long admired as
  a ""mecca"" for non-motorized travel, as well as welcoming and
  effective public spaces, the Dutch offer a glimpse of what “could be”
  elsewhere in the world. This summer, we are taking our family to five
  cities in The Netherlands to immerse ourselves in the Dutch lifestyle
  and really experience a model livable city. Specifically Amsterdam,
  Rotterdam, Utrecht, Eindhoven and Groningen. The experience will allow us to better inform our writing and
  photography, but also give Coralie and Etienne, our children, the
  opportunity to see another part of this wonderful world they live in.
  Not to mention that having them along for the ride will give us a
  better impression of city planning that takes all ages and abilities
  into account. Drawing from our experiences, we will also be producing
  an illustrated article about each city, as well as five short videos
  that capture just a glimpse what each city offers. Travelling is an incredibly rewarding experience, but also requires a
  large investment. The money we raise through this campaign will help
  cover the costs of travel, accomodations, and equipment, take some of
  the stress out of the process, meaning we can really focus on the
  adventure ahead. Funding will also provide us more freedom to really
  experience what its like to live in another part of the world, and
  create a more rewarding event. We are happy for any contribution, no matter how small, to make this

"Hello! We are Jerry 'Wolf' & LindaSue
  'Spirit"" Stage.  We are 58 and 51 years young respectfully.  We
  are also Native American descendants that have a small beadwork  &
  crafts business that we run part time and online.  Wolf is also a US
  Navy veteran. The VA recently discovered nodules in
  Wolf's lungs and on his vocal cords (non-cancerous) caused by living
  in an apartment with black mold.  Even after moving from the
  situation, the VA doctors have determined that his current work
  environment is just aggravating the nodules.  While he is not
  classified as disabled, he has been advised to leave the current work
  situation due to this condition and find something else.  But getting
  ready to turn 59, there are not a lot of work opportunities available.
  And neither one of us want to be added to an already over-burdened
  Social Security payout system. Long story short - we need to earn an
  honest living without doing more damage to his health or living off of
  the government. The Goal and Plan: Right now we have a craft business based on our Native heritage.  We
  are currently scheduled for 7-8 powwows this year.  We also sell
  online and at various craft fairs.  While we know we will not likely
  become rich from doing this, we do believe that we can earn an honest,
  self-sufficient living by being able to travel freely and adding more
  to the schedule.  And it will be doable without the day to day
  responsibilities that come with a permanent home base. We did try this before but did not have a solid plan in place and
  ended up living out of our van.  That situation didn't work very well
  due to the confined space and being unable to do the basics needed to
  survive properly.  This time, we do have a plan. Our Plans - Step by Step: Right now we have a step-by-step action plan in mind and would like
  to share it with you here: #1 - The first $300 will be used to have a properly installed
  hitch/wiring system done at our local U-Haul dealership.  This way we
  will know exactly what our towing capabilities will be on our '98
  Chevy Blazer.  And we will be sure that everything is done safely and
  correctly.  Planning to do this full-time, a ""gum and baling
  wire"" setup will NOT work. #2 - We are currently scouring Craigslist for
  a decent pop-up tent trailer or smaller camper (under 4000 lbs towing
  weight).  We have seen prices in the range of $900 - $2500 that would
  fit our needs.  One that we would like to get ahold of is shown in the
  following photos and is priced at $2000.  But we all know how
  Craigslist works and will keep checking daily as funds start building. #3 - In order to be completely
  self-sufficient, we are planning to add a solar panel system and
  generator so we do not have to rely on paid campsites, yet still have
  the comforts of home.  We have found that through Harbor Freight, this
  can be done for under $600 (or even less if we can catch these on sale) We Need Your Help To Make This Happen In A Timely Manner! Right now Wolf is still working part-time
  at the current job.  He has gotten his hours cut enough to just barely
  make our weekly responsibilities but he does need to get out of there
  completely to protect his health before the nodules have a more
  serious and permanent effect on his health.  With the events that we
  currently have scheduled, we will be doing our very best to get this
  plan into full motion.  But to be completely honest, we can't do it
  without YOUR help. We understand that times are rough for
  everyone right now, but even $5 can go a long way.  That is just 740
  people adding $5 to this.  I believe in human nature and I believe
  that there ARE 740 people that can do this (that is less than a value
  meal at McDonald's).  In the overall scheme of things, I do honestly
  believe this can be done.  BUT it has to start with 1 or 2 people
  making that initial help.  If you have read this far, it means that
  you have an interest in the venture.  I believe that we can count on you. Thank you, Spirit & Wolf",159,of $1.2k goal,https://fundrazr.com/livingfreeandhealthy,Living Free & Productive Lives On The Road F/T,8,U.S. Dollar

  go to improve our  Mandarin Chinese speaking skills and learn to
  better understand & appreciate the Taiwanese culture. But we NEED
  YOUR HELP to make this trip go from a dream to reality!!  We are
  seeking sponsorship to aquire the funds needed to make this trip
  possible! The money will go towards passports, round trip plane

  with one of our best friends and his family!  Benson Chui has come to
  America and stayed with our family as a foreign exchange student for
  the past two years. Now we can go stay with him and meet his family.
  We really hope that we can take advantage of this amazing  opportunity
  that his family invited us to come and take part of. Please consider
  giving to a great cause, to growing and forever enriching our
  educational experience! We know this trip will help us see people
  differently, help us recognize we are all much more alike throughout

"I am a 15 year old who is looking to embark upon an amazing
    experience in helping families in need. The Peru expedition is run
    by camps international. This organisation gives children the
    opportunity to go out to various different countries in different
    parts of the world and help children and families in need. This is a
    four week long trip in the summer of 2016. While I am out in Peru, I will be helping the local
    communities out with their everyday work and any other jobs they
    need doing. Not only this, but I will be planting tons of trees as
    the deforestation over there is immense. I might even start building a school there as the schools over
    in Peru are just walls and the floor. I will be visiting different parts of Peru and walking
    tremendous distances, along the way I will be helping the
    communities, building schools, planting trees, improving areas,
    talking to the families and playing with the children. Not only
    this, but I will be helping to improve the standard of living for
    rural communities and taking part in ongoing conservation activities
    to protect valuable and sensitive ecological areas. As well as all
    the charity work, I will be trekking the iconic Machu picchu and
    visiting lake Titicaca as well as learning Spanish along the way. So, please donate to this fantastic adventure and cause, any
    donation helps! I have to raise a total of £3,890 but by donating,

"A hearty Hello from Benji, Emily, Julie and Jackson! Our story is that the four of us met through outdoor work that we all
  care about. We recognized that we all hold nature and expeditions as
  very important to us. When the dream of an Arctic sea kayaking tour
  was created everyone was eager. Our dream is not just for a big expedition. We would like to
  explore wild parts of our country. Search and connect to help find
  meaning to the risk we will pursue. Through that connect with an
  environment and its people. Through it all we think it is important to
  share the relevance and learning that we find. We deeply believe our
  story will be an adventurous, enlightening and hopefully an inspiring one. The reality of major expedition planning is slightly off from
  what is imagined. We do spend much time pouring over maps and
  practicing skills. However, the cost of our enterprise is a
  considerable one. We all have modest incomes from our pursuit of
  adventure employment and have become creative in acquiring resources
  for this trip. We have presented public talks, applied for grants,
  recycled, been dehydrating food for months and now are crowd funding.
  We would love any support you feel you would like to donate. Our expedition is a rugged and lofty endeavor. It will be work,
  gear and calorie intensive. If you feel inspired to help support young
  adventurers here is where some of your money could go. $10 is a days food for one person $20 is one of our 17
  nautical charts $50 is a days worth of food and fuel for the
  whole team $80 is one of our two stoves $285 is an emergency
  personal locator beacon $500 is our Ice Bear Alarm bear fence to
  circle our tent Other costs are the shipping of resupply goods and food, remote
  safety insurance, as well as, kayak related gear. I guess I should
  mention an exciting spice kit as well! For all those who are motivated
  to donate, we thank you. We hope we also inspire you to follow our

"Hello, my name is Hannah and I need help achieving a dream. On the internet, you can recognize me as ""Hannah Bee"", with
  the Twitter handle @GraciasToGracie . In real life
  though, I am a practicing Radiologic Technologist based from the Philippines. WCPW means so much to me as it helps me get over the stresses that
  the Medical profession brings. I have made a lot of close friends
  through the promotion! In turn, I have also made a lot of fanworks for
  the promotion, both serious and light-hearted in nature. It's my dream to see and experience WCPW live. I picked the March
  tapings to aim to go to as it'll be my 21st birthday on March 23, and
  it'll be a hell of a way to celebrate it! The only thing that's hindering me would be the costs to fly to
  London. My salary is not enough for me to save up for a flight. Also,
  I am too young to get a loan. I have no options left for me to try on,
  except this one. The money will be used to fund my flight to the UK for the Loaded
  tapings on London. They will be held on March 13, 2017, 7 PM GMT, on
    the Coronet Theatre. Not only will I go to see quality
    professional wrestling, I will also get a chance to meet other fans
    and friends I have made through the internet for the past year! Every bit counts. A contribution and/or a share helps me a lot to
  achieve my dream. Thank you very much in advance! IMPORTANT NOTE: - IF IN ANY CASE THE FLIGHT DOES NOT COME INTO FRUTITION, I
    WILL BE DONATING EVERY CENT TO KYTHE FOUNDATION, INC . Kythe is a non-profit, non-stock organization aimed towards
    improving the quality of life among hospitalized children with
    cancer and other chronic illness. FAQ 1. Why can't you finance it yourself? - Working as a radiographer in the Philippines isn't as rewarding
  unlike in other countries. My weekly salary is just ~£23, and that's
  still up for tax deduction! 2. Why can't you turn to other people for help? - Unfortunately, I have not much options to ask help from. We all
  know how non-wrestling fans view all of this, then intensify that with
  the culture we have around here. I think that the fans are the best
  people who can understand how much important this will be for me.
  Friends have convinced me to try crowd funding out, since I have
  nothing to lose at this point. 3. What makes you worth it? - I don't know, to be honest. I'm just a fan who got impacted a lot
  with what they do on and off the camera. Basically, they have brought my smile back during a really dark time
  in my life. They also inspired me to finish through everything, from
  the last months of my medical training to my licensure examinations. I
  have also met great friends through them! In turn, I have made a lot of fan works for them, both serious and
  light-hearted. Never did I expect that all of these will have
  something in return, really. Unlike how some view it, I did them to
  show appreciation and love, no dark master plan shenanigans. 4. Do you need $1,500? Really? - I was just being transparent of the costs of the flight. It does
  not necessarily mean I need to get $1,500 from you all.  I'm still
  trying all my best to save up! 5. Why can't you share it on FB? - Crowd funding is greatly frowned upon in our culture, and I'm
  really not keen on having personal conflict with family, friends, and

"When it comes to personal fundraising I try to stay away from
    things that aren't Health and Emergency related. It's been a hard
    year for me, however a small beacon of happiness emerged in my life
    and that was SHINee. I have depression and BPD but rediscovering
    SHINee, and most particularly their music has been incredibly
    uplifting for me. It's been 8 years since their debut but they're
    finally coming to North America for a few concerts and the closest
    one to me is Dallas. I was incredibly excited ago, especially since
    it is tax return season and once I would recieve my check from the
    IRS I would be able to cover my whole trip. But unfortunately I was
    sent an email from the IRS stating that because of how my taxes were
    filed, a new law required my tax return to be delayed. So it's hard
    swallowing my pride but I could really use your help, no matter how
    big or small it would be appreciated. If you are someone who follows
    my channel on youtube I would be able to fulfill special request
    videos for you, if you're a local friend who needs help with
    something, whether it's sewing a costume, cleaning your car, or
    walking your dog I'd be happy to. The lowest goal for my campaign is
    100 dollars as this would cover the cheapest ticket (with fees and
    such) and any extra paypal fees. The most expensive ticket is 215

"I need help raising the funds to attend the annual convention in Portland, Oregon hosted by the Hearing Loss Assocaiton of America (HLAA). The Hearing Loss Association of America (HLAA) is the nation’s leading organization representing people with hearing loss.  check their website for more info: http://hearingloss.org/ I was able to attend HLAA's convention last year in Providence, RI on a first time attendee scholarship. This convention was life changing and it motivated me to continue advocating for change.  Many young adults are not able to afford the costs associated with attending conventions; therefore, they will miss out on many life-defining moments. Such costs include convention registrations, travel, and lodging. Therefore, myself and my peers started the ""100 Portland"" initiative. We DECLARED that 100 young adults (YA) will be present at the June (27th-30th) 2013 HLAA Convention in Portland, Oregon. - WATCH VIDEO ABOVE FOR MORE INFORMATION on '100 Portland'- Link to 100 Portland Facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/100Portland/ The purpose of this Fundrazr page is to ask for my friends and family to contribute to fund my trip to the convention. It is my goal to raise about $900 to cover the expenses that include: convention registration, lodging, and transportation. Your support would allow me to continue learning information to cope with my hearing loss and to connect with my peers at the convention. There's no greater feeling than to feel connected with others that are going through life the same way. Another reason why I want to attend, is to continue working on my documentary project: Hear Nor There: Images of an Invisible Disability  http://www.marisasarto.com/#!hear-nor-there/c1yei Therefore, you would be supporting my project to document stories of individuals with hearing loss and the challenges that they face. Your name will be mention in the final project! WAYS TO GIVE: donate by PayPal here on Fundrazr or donate by check – you can send a check to me: Marisa Sarto, 7000 Quakertown Ave. Winnetka, CA 91306.

Taking pride in my academics I have felt the need to expand beyond the boundaries of school for learning.  When my history teacher presented the annual Europe Trip to us students, I became ecstatic thinking about traveling to the one place on earth I have dreamed of going since I can remember.

This missions internship is a graduation requirement for me, but it is also an opportunity of a lifetime. I am so excited to learn and experience what I have always dreamed of doing with my life; and that is working alongside missionaries and non-profit organizations as a humanitarian worker using my photography and digital media skills to further their ministry. I will start out in northern India working together with a team from Valley Forge Christian College for about two weeks. Our ministry there will be concentrated around building relationships with children and youth, exposing Jesus to them through our actions. Once the two weeks have ended, I will leave to go work with OneHope all around India. OneHope is a non-profit organization whose mission is, “to affect destiny by providing God’s eternal Word to all the children and youth of the world.” While I am working with OneHope, I will be serving in many different ways, but I will mostly be documenting OneHope’s work by interviewing children about how God has changed their lives. I cannot express enough how excited I am for this trip, but I cannot get there on my own. The total cost of this trip is $3,500. It is my sincere hope that you will want to partner with me and so participate in the fruit from this effort. Any amount you can give will be deeply appreciated.

"Hi my name is Shannen Kennedy and I am a senior in high school.  In just a few short months I will be graduating and I’m looking forward to a new chapter in my life.   I am currently working part time as a nanny and at a local frozen yogurt store.  I have five younger sisters, two older brothers, and two amazing parents. My dad is a children’s pastor at Christ the Rock Community Church and my mom has a full time job as a “stay at home” mom among many other things.  I have always loved working with people (especially kids) and have decided to pursue a career in pediatric nursing. Over the past few years I have felt the Lord leading me into the mission field.  In 2011, I was part of a team from my church that traveled to the Dominican Republic.  We spent ten days working with children in an orphanage.  This experience changed my life!  I believe this step of faith has led me to where I am today…and the desire to serve in a more long-term ministry in Africa.  This fall I am planning to head to Uganda for six months to work with the organization Empower A Child. While there, I will be working in primary & secondary schools, juvenile detention centers, and the Babies Home (for orphaned children 0-5 years old).  I will participate in a sports ministry and help with ongoing construction projects.  I will also volunteer at Katalemwa, a hospital for children with severely broken limbs and disabilities.  In every venue, I will be sharing the gospel, leading small groups & worship, performing skits and helping to organize “day camps” for large groups of children.  I believe this experience will not only grow me spiritually, but challenge me emotionally. I realize that my participation in this missions trip is dependent on the support it will take to get there.  I am trusting that the Lord will provide in every area, including finances.

My pilgrimage seeks to put a light on our need to work harder to keep the peace. We have to strive to put up resistance against xenophobia and mistrust. I will start walking in mid november and I´m counting on arriving in Jerusalem in may 2013. Then I will have walked some 4500 kilometers. I will be walking under the patronage of Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem which is a organisation for humanitarian aid. Since my organisation itself is dependent on charity I will have to raise my own funds. During the pilgrimage I will continously keep an updated blog and Facebookpage so you can follow my journey.,350,,https://fundrazr.com/fMqy3,Pilgrimage for Peace - Towards Jerusalem,,

"Our family won a spot in the White House Easter Egg Roll on Monday, April 1. Of course, in order to accept this spot, we have to get to Washington, DC by 7:30 AM on Monday, April 1, and doing so would be a financial burden for our family that we just can't swing. Someone suggested that we do a fundraiser to offset the cost of the trip. Having a family like ours at such a high profile event is important for several reasons: 1. We are a lesbian family, we matter. 2. We are fat and active, and Michelle Obama needs to see that. 3. Our children are adorable, everyone should get to be with them before the awkward stage sets in. We estimate that the minimum we'd need to help us out is $1000 (rental car, meals, hotel, Metro fares, etc.), but I set the goal at $2000 because that will cover the trip entirely, making things a little less tight when we come back to real life. If you'd like to donate miles so we can fly instead of drive, let us know and we'll try to work that out. We'd love your help, and we'd love it if you shared this with people who might also be willing to help.

"Dreams come true or at least that’s what I’ve been told. I’ve always chosen to dream big (and I mean BIG!) because I believe that if you want or believe in something you should always try your best to make it happen. What’s the point of daydreaming about something if you’re never going to follow through anyway? A dream should be something you look forward to, not something you regret never accomplishing. This fund-raiser is the first step towards this crazy dream of mine, one step closer to the real thing. I will be leaving our beautiful city to travel to Europe for over 4 months to experience a whole new culture. Some people travel to find themselves and some are trying to get lost. I want to see the world through my own eyes and not have to rely on my imagination and the books from the travelling section at chapters. I want to see the colours, taste the food, smell the air, and meet the people. I want those raw unexpected experiences that make life incredible. I want to feel lost and then found and then lost again. I don’t want to find answers; I want to find better questions. I WANT TO EXPLORE! Travelling is like being a kid all over again because we surround ourselves with what we don’t understand; we adapt, we grow- we live. True love exists, for me its travel.

"Hey folks! So as many of you know, I'll be traveling to Ireland to be volunteering on organic farms for 3 1/2 months this summer. I already have my plane tickets, however I may need a little help with the finances for supplies and travel costs. I don't normally like to ask for donations, but trust me, keep reading and you will find that there may be something in this for you too... But first, a little about why I'm going. Currently I work full time as a pantry chef at Peche, a local restaurant which strives to create quality food from mostly local and organic ingredients. Our menu changes daily based on what we have in stock, seasonal changes, and cost efficiency. My goal on this trip is to discover more about food and environmental sustainability, and how we can create a community which may one day pride itself on making good food and food education more accessible to the masses. I believe that if we want global social change, we have to start locally. Changing the way we think about food is one of the most basic and important aspects of such. I believe that these principles could be the catalyst for change in many other social and political realms, and that it is our responsibility to work with the environment and resources that we have here and now. I dream of a world where one hamburger doesn't consist of meat from over 1,000 different tortured and corn fed cows, or produce that is not chemically ripened and shipped over 5,000 miles. If that makes me an idealist, I'll I take it as a compliment. During this trip I will be traveling all around the country, learning about organic gardening, honey cultivation, wine making, and livestock maintenance, just to name a few things. I will also be spending some time working in one of the first organic kitchens in Ireland. Here I will be polishing up on my cooking skills, and learning about food in it's truest form... from the ground up. Despite how corny as that may sound, it's true (and I wonder how many food puns I can fit into this synopsis...). Anyway, coming down from my soap box, here's the most important part: You. I understand the importance of reciprocity, and I would like to offer you this: -A donation of $5 or more will get you a fancy postcard -$25 or more will get you a t-shirt -$50 or more will get you a recipe book, from the recipes I acquire in Ireland -$75 (per person) or more I will cook you a meal of your choice (i.e., breakfast, lunch or dinner) with food from a local farmers market upon my return (restricted to central Texas residents) -And if you're feeling really generous, $100 (per person) will get you:  a cooking lesson with tips on how to make your food last the longest (easily and efficiently, to avoid letting it go to waste, also restricted to central Texas residents). -I am flexible and open to discussion if you have other preferences of how you would like to redeem your return gift (ex: if you would like me to cook dinner for a group of people, or your family, give you or a group multiple cooking lessons, or something of the like). The more you donate, the more I will give back. So if you donate $50, you will get a recipe book, a t-shirt, and a postcard, etc, unless you specify otherwise. Though I will also be getting another part time job to supplement, sometimes we get by with a little help from our friends. Anything helps. Thanks for reading.

It must be impossible to learn to speak Chinese unless you're born there!"" Then, when I was about to start my sophomore year of High School, my parents asked me how I would feel about hosting an exchange student from China. I was super excited about it and ended up making a great friend and ""sister"" that year. As a freshman at Arizona State University, I wanted to go on a trip over the summer. My first choice was to do an internship at Disney World, but I missed the deadline to apply, so I ended up going to China for 6 weeks with several of my friends. A year later, I had the opportunity to go back for a full school year and study with some of my best friends. I was able to make some great friends, experience the culture and grow tremendously in my personal life. I've been back in the U.S. for almost three years now, and I miss China every day!

"I am in an ongoing battle against depression, and I need a break. This situation has led to me falling behind in my study, going into therapy, and being in a constant state of... well... depression. Throughout this, there have been a couple of things that have kept me going (and sane); my friends, family, therapy, and the prospect of starting Game Design. However, things have been shaky at best. The current situation makes it very possible I won't be able to finish English this year, which will not just mean that I'll have to spend thousands of extra euros to get my bachelor degree, but also that I will 'lose' another year. If I do manage to finish things this year, I'll be thrown straight back into another study which, although I want to do it, will also cost me a lot of time and money. What I really need is a break. This summer holiday, from basically the 1st of July to the 31st of August, I want to go to Australia, to visit one of my closest friend and the person who has saved my life in this period more than once. However, tickets to Australia seem to be... expensive. I cannot pay for this considering my financial situation. Now I know what many of you will think: look for a job, work for that money! But honestly, right now it is taking all my effort to just stay sane and still work on my study at the same time, so even if I could find a job right now, it would hurt me more than it would help me. That is why I'm asking for help, and frankly the tiniest bit could help right now. I am stuck between a rock and a hard place, and am slowly slipping into more and more problems, and, like I've said multiple times, I need a break. I intend to give back: First and foremost I will make a booklet of poetry available here. Of course, if you hate poetry you can ignore it, but I just want to at least offer something for any help I might get. Also, if you want something back for your donation, be sure to ask me. Think of a drawing, a video, writing, a hug, me playing/singing a song for you, anything really. I feel bad about asking for help, but lately I've not had much of a choice.",420,of €805 goal,https://fundrazr.com/bU9Z4,Project Keep Mike Sane! (Or; Take A Break!),14,Euro
"Many of you have read my previous post on prayer request for my dear friend and brother in Christ, Herman Moreno. His son Omar Moreno was involved in a head on collision back in their home of Guatemala. He is in serious condition and is under going extensive surgery to repair his wounds.

"My daughter Cidney has been accepted into the local Student Ambassador Program. People To People, has offered her the only remaining spot on their trip to Italy, France and Spain.  While traveling through these three European countries, she will learn about the culture, the history and the magnificence of travel.  Being a sophomore in high school, she has already started looking at colleges and universities; however, her course of study is currently unknown.  As the program requires, academics are a priority; she is currently ranked 12th in her class with a 4.0 GPA in advanced placement courses.  I believe that this trip will open up doors for her, allow her to gain valuable life skills and lead her towards her academic goals.  She will also be automatically enrolled in the tuition-paid course “Ambassadorial Studies” offered through the Washington School of World Studies and earn the equivalent of 1 high school semester elective credit.  There is wanderlust that flows through her veins, urging her to go and explore, but she needs your help. The cost of the trip is roughly $8,000.00.  She is employed part-time and working hard to do her part and save, but she would immensely appreciate if you would be willing to donate towards her cause.  If you can make even a small donation of ten dollars or more, you will be helping her achieve her dream.  The saying, “A little goes a long way”, is inerrant when it comes to her situation.

"Hello family & friends! As you may know, I am currently coming to the end of my third year in the McMaster Bachelor of Science Nursing program with only one year to go! I'm not sure where I'm going to make my mark as a nurse yet, but I am on the road to become a Nurse Practitioner and am very passionate about improving health in the north. I have been nominated to participate in an International Scholar Laureate Delegation on Nursing in Australia where I will visit medical centre's & universities to learn about health and Australia's model health care system. I am particularly interested in gaining knowledge about Australia's indigenous populations, which is one of the oldest in the world and extremely similar to that of Canada. I am hoping that the knowledge and understanding gained from this experience will be useful in helping to improve health care in Northern Ontario where it is desperately needed. So why the page? Just like any education it comes at a cost, tuition for the program is $3,399, and the cost of the round trip flight will is $1,789 - while I have two extremely supportive parents, this cost is a large burden and ANY help that you can offer is so greatly appreciated! To earn your support I am attempting to cover as much distance as possible swimming laps over the next two months! My first idea was to set my goal at 8,403 miles, which is the distance as the crow flies from Canada to the land down under; but I will likely reach a couple hundred kilometres if I am determined and hope someone ""gives me a lift"" the rest of the way. haha. I will be tracking my distance here online after each swim with affirmation from the lifeguards & one of my nursing tutors to ensure my accountability along the way.

"Hello, my name is Brittany Cote and I am from Howell, New Jersey. I am a junior at Howell High School. Recently, I applied to go abroad to the 2013 summer program to Japan, through the AFS (American Field Service) Intercultural Student Exchange Program. During my stay I hope to make a difference and gain a better knowledge of the world and who I am as a person. I have always loved Japan's culture and language since I was young. Ever since I could remember, I have always dreamed about goin to Japan and emersing myself with the people and, their communities. This program is something I am very passionate about and, I hope to succeed and prosper in the language and culture. AFS has always been apart of my life, when my Dad was 16 he went to Africa and, my Aunt also went to Japan when she was a teenager through AFS as well. My family and I have also hosted a girl from Japan (Ayumi), who stayed with us for a whole year in 2011. It is my dream to become either a garphic designer or an ESL teacher. Before that though, I hope to become a better person and, help others along my way in Japan. Right now, as a junior, I have to manage to keep myself organized. Whether it's dealing with a mass of homework, SAT's, studying, sports, friends, and trying to get some sleep. In my school I am on the lacrosse, and field hockey team. and part of a club called ""Next 2 Records"". In this group we produce/record our own school record label, its very fun and exciting to watch how everything comes together at the end. I am also in a special program at my school called, FPAC. It's a performing arts program and I am in the technology/music branch of it. In the technology/music branch (ET) we work with computers, music programs, and help work school shows. This is a very hectic and busy program but, its very rewarding in the end to see how hard and, well you've worked over the past 4 years of high school. Learning and experiencing new things is a huge part of my life, so are my family, friends, and school. In my family giving back and, helping others is a big part of who we are. I am ecstatic to be apart of AFS and, to let others know what they stand for. And, I hope that I will be apart of such a great opportunity. Hopefully, I can raise enough money for this once in a lifetime experience-along with this page and fundraising/working-! My goal is to raise between $2000-$3000 in the next 4 months to help cover a fraction of the costs.

"I have an awesome opportunity to go on a student ambassador trip to Australia this summer for 20 days!  I am asking family and friends to help sponsor my trip.  Mom and dad said I could go if I raised or earned at least 75% of the money.  I really really want to go!!!!   $6,999 includes airfare, travel, lodging, food, and activities which works out to $350 a day. I want to go with People to People because I will get to go to places normal people only dream of going.  It will help me get into a great college and getting an awesome job.  It means learning and seeing places I won't forget.  Mainly it's a way to get to know a culture.  Other countries think Texas is a place without cars and we have horses and that it's sandy and western cowboy style. But it's not, it's so much more. I'd love to go to Australia this year.

"My goal is to raise enough money for a round trip plane ticket for myself to France in December of this year. Why you ask? OK, are you ready for the most romantic story you've ever heard? In June this year, I met my soul mate. I know how that sounds, but it's true. I had a very strong gut feeling to walk to a particular place on the waterfront one evening, and when I got there, he was standing there.  It was an instant knowing for both of us, like we had known each other forever. We spent every second together from then on until...... he went back to France.  He's there till he finishes his degree in January, then moving his lovely self here to Seattle. Can we wait to be together till January?  Of course, he's even coming to this side of the pond in August for a week, so we would only be apart for 5 months. Everyone I have told this story to so far though has been more than willing to help out, so I thought I would put this out to the universe and see what came of it. He's finishing up his PhD, and for anyone who knows someone going through this, it's a ridiculously stressful time.  I would love to be able to be there for him during this to help calm him down and support him though it.

This is a VERY EXCITING OPPORTUNITY for me and I would like to take full advantage! This program will take me to Australia for 14 days this summer. While in Australia, I will learn about and have to opportunity to visit and observe Parliament House; snorkel in the Great Barrier Reef, learning about it's marine life and the health of the reef; attend a performance at the Sydney Opera House and have an exclusive backstage pass tour to study the Opera House architecture. I will also stay on a farm, meet Aborigine people and take part in some of their traditional food, dance and survival techniques- boomerang throwing! I will volunteer at a school in Brisbane and donate supplies, while seeing what and how kids my age learn in Australia. And this is just a preview of the things I will do, there is soo much, I can't write it all. Imagine being in 5th grade and having the opportunity of a lifetime! The only draw back is this program is VERY expensive. The total trip will cost over $11,000.

"It is my Mom Carol's dream to travel to Durban, South Africa this summer to participate in the World Transplant Games and I desperately want to help her achieve that dream. For Christmas my sister and I gave her 4,000+ Air Miles points to help her with the airfare but that was not enough and the rest of the travel costs are becoming more than she can afford. So this year in leu of a birthday card or gift or even the time it takes to wish me ""Happy Birthday"", I would prefer if you would please donate $5-$25 towards making my Mom's dream come true. Many of you know that  in 2008 my Mom contracted a rare condition simply called organizing pneumonia while overseas. After a month in a drug induced coma, almost 3 years of living on supplemental oxygen not being able to care for her self (and coming VERY close to loosing her battle) on June 26th 2009 my Mom received a double lung transplant thanks to some one we will never know. Someone who gave the greatest gift someone could ever give, life to another human being. After the operation she underwent a number of complications that kept her in the hospital for six months and it took her more than a year after that to truly get back on her feet. Now she is enjoying spending time with her four grand kids whom without this gift she would have never met. In her spare time she has become the Race Director of the Waterloo Transplant Trot and has been working in schools all across the GTA to educate kids on the importance of Organ and Tissue donation. If you don't want to donate here, you can always send me an email money transfer to chadweir[at]me[dot]com. I promise to be 100% transparent with the money raised and will report to everyone how much we made and pass along a photos and videos of her trip this summer! Thank you in advance.

"So, my birthday’s coming up on August 7th… and I’m planning to spend it in Ghana, Africa at the Father’s House!  But I need your help to get me there. On my fifth birthday, my parents got on a plane and headed to Ghana.  We had no idea then that there would someday be a place called the Father’s House.  Now, almost ten years later, there are eight boys living there who I consider my brothers.  Two and a half years ago, those same boys were living on Lake Volta as child slaves.  They were fed only one meal per day and were frequently abused.  Before dawn each day, their masters woke them and forced them to fish, which often included diving into the dark waters to untangle the nets.  One of the boys at the Father’s House saw a friend dive under.  He was entangled in the nets and never returned to the surface.  This is just one of many stories from their time on the lake. Before they were rescued, many of the boys didn’t even know when their birthdays were.  Now, they all get so excited and love celebrating them.  I am so happy I’ll be celebrating mine with them this year.  I couldn’t ask for a better birthday present.  In order for me to celebrate with all my brothers, I’m taking Andrew, my American brother, with me too.  The cost for both of us to go is $5,000.  I would be so grateful if you could help us.

"Upon hearing once that life continues to reflect back to us the fundamental promises we make to ourselves, it immediately struck a chord and remained resonant within me. The promises we make do come back to us whether we honor them or not. Simply put, our promises fulfilled or left undone, become a sort of marker of our own integrity. I have both kept promises and failed to as well. What began as a promise to myself to follow and know my own heart (leading me to Africa, and more specifically, Ethiopia thus meeting the love of my life) has come full-circle. Right now I am face-to-face with the most profound commitment that I have ever made. As a man, a father, and a husband I am asking you for help to fulfill my vow to bring Hana and myself back to Ethiopia. Six years ago my wife, Abeba, a native Ethiopian, died. Our daughter Hana, also born in her mother's land, was three when we experienced this untimely passing. After laying Abeba to rest we left Ethiopia--- lost, broken…but with a thread connecting our heart's to both our departed loved one and her place of origin. On her death bed, I promised Abeba to bring Hana back to spend time with her family, allowing them to know one another and steep Hana in the culture which had so beautifully poured forth from her mother's very soul--- to offer her that piece so relevant, yet inaccessible from my own blood and perspective. Since then our journey has been a trajectory of healing and return; a fulfillment of this powerful and palpable promise. As a father, I want Hana to experience the poetry and hardship of life in Dire Dawa (Mama's birthplace)--- to understand what time of day you need to draw a pail of water and put it in the sun so that you have hot water to bathe as the light settles behind the branches of acacia trees. I desire that Hana be mothered by a village of aunties; to learn how to mill teff flour by hand and grind salt gathered from the nearby plains…to prepare the foods which have nourished her people for ages. I long to witness her dance, surrendering to the music and rhythms that she knows from cellular memory. For me, it is clear that I need to return to Ethiopia in order to refuel and be nurtured by the family centered, Earth based, feminine culture that I fell in love with—that I married. It’s time to go home. Through the generous help of a dear friend, we are finally about to purchase tickets and are leaving in just about three weeks for Addis Ababa to be welcomed by the familiarity of faces we have tenderly guarded in our memory for what has seemed lifetimes. From there we will travel to Dire Dawa and stay with various members of a huge extended family for as long as we are able. I am humbly asking for your financial help to maximize our time on the ground. Hana and I are seeking  to raise at least $3700, which would give us 3 months in country... Each $1000 equates to a month's daily living expenses, plus $700 towards visas and other incidentals. As some of you may know, I am a health counselor and personal macrobiotic/vegan/raw foods chef. I have worked tirelessly for the last 16+ years to aid others and shine a light on their own unique journeys back to self. Part of my vision for a sustainable future for my daughter and I is to offer online coaching/consulting/support--- working with others one-on-one to facilitate a return to heath, wellness, and awakening toward more conscious-based nutrition...all the while volunteering my awareness to those with need--- locals we encounter on our way who may reciprocate with barter of a meal or place for us to stay...but mostly just giving back freely to a place and a people which has gifted me so much. It will mean my working in a completely different capacity, with new parameters and dynamics--- all of which remain as unknowns. This area of our sustenance is equally in transition. Of all the ways that keeping this undying promise to my late wife is softening me and bringing me to a new edge of faith, this career shift seems the scariest part of this whole endeavor.

"There once a little girl who asked her family to immerse her in the
  British culture. “Drown me in the music, the fashion, the accents,”
  she said. So they did. They bought her a red pea coat (that she still
  wears to this day); brought her a Powell family crest from Britain
  that likely isn’t even from one single blood relative; let her wear
  the British flag as if it were her country of origin; turned her onto
  off-colored British television. These all contributed to a child’s
  idea of what it meant to be British. This little girl’s New Year’s resolution was to talk like a Brit for
  a year and document her journey. This girl was ten or eleven years
  old. And like most adults with New Year’s resolutions, her “journey”
  died after only a few weeks. Now at 22, this little girl wishes to be truly a part of the British
  culture by crossing the Atlantic and seeing why the sun never sets on
  the British empire. For those that know this girl’s true journey, they know that not only
  was she a person whose life has been consumed by the magic of music,
  but consumed by the possibilities that lie in her future. One thing
  has not changed: she is still consumed by the art that is others’
  musical miseries and triumphs. However, the future that she so clearly
  envisioned has now become blurred. What once was a three year-old going on 30 is now a 22-year-old who
  has no idea what she wants to be when she grows up. After graduating
  from CSUN with a degree in Psychology and having had the opportunity
  to serve her peers in various public offices, the next logical step to
  advance herself and her career would be to go to graduate school.
  After months of internal debate and consultation to those closest to
  her, schooling is the last thing she needs. It’s really experience
  that she craves. And what better way to gain that than by exploring
  the world? On this trip, she hopes to not only open her eyes to a whole
    new world, but to experience it through music and service. Amidst
    seeing some of the world’s greatest wonders, she’ll be attending
    music festivals and concerts as well as dedicating at least three
    hours at every major destination to serving the less fortunate. Through your contributions, large or small, you’ll be helping a
  little girl in a big girl’s body discover what it really means to be a

"Help to Make our Christmas Wish Come True! I am trying to get enough money together to get home for Christmas
  and bring Rich with me. Flight costs have sky-rocketed this year, with
  a single ticket (not even direct) costing in excess of £1,000.00
  (that's over $1,500.00 for the Americans out there!)...each! Needless
  to say, this is extortionate. As if that wasn't bad enough, Rich and I
  have just moved into a house (renting) which has been an enormous
  expense (getting the deposit, paying rent a month in advance, getting
  tables, shelves, a lawnmower, etc) and as a result we are struggling
  to be able to afford to get home for Christmas. Why is it important for me to get home? Every year at Christmas the house is full: my sister, brother in law,
  neice and nephew fly in from LA, my Granny and usually one of my dad's
  sisters fly over from Switzerland and/or England, my brothers both get
  time off work, my friends from college and high school are all around
  - basically, it's the only time I get to see everyone all at once and
  it's a very special time for me! I am desperate for Rich to experience
  the joys of Christmas in my home (even if we do have to sleep on the
  floor ;) ) - plus he's never met a lot of my extended family
  (including my Granny) and this would mean the world to me. A few years ago I suffered an abrupt and tragic loss. It was this
  loss that made me realise how short life is and though Rich keeps
  saying ""I'll save up and go next year,"" you just never know
  if you will get a next year, so you have to take advantage of the now!
  (Not to mention next year the prices will probably double again anyway). All I can do is plead - and I am a proud person who does not often
  ask for help, but in the spirit of giving and the spirit of Christmas
  I would ask for this small token from you. If you were going to buy me a drink next time you see me, please
  don't - put £5.00 in the fund instead. If you were going to send me a
  card, please don't - put £1.00 in the fund instead. We will feel
  grateful for anything we receive - be it $1.00 or £1.00, $20.00,
  £50.00, even if it's as small as quarters, pence or pennies. We will
  be grateful for any and all help we can get to get over to Florida for Christmas! In return for this, I can give back as well! I am very good with
  Excel, Word, presentations, cooking, cleaning, dog walking,
  babysitting - you name it, and I'll try! Plus I will be posting a
  number of photos and videos from our time over there (if we can make
  it!) to show you just how happy you have made us - please please
  please consider giving...you will ceratinly help to make this a

"A unique & once in a life time event for me but I need your
  help!! I need your sponsorship & support to travel to Japan with
  the People to People Ambassador Program. Being an Ambassador of the United States, especially in today’s
  climate, means a great deal to me. I believe with this program, my
  fellow students, and I can spread compassion and acceptance of one
  another regardless of our physical distinctions. Simply, by
  understanding our cultural differences. I hope that working together
  with my peers in Japan we will all realize we want the same things in
  life. Peace. Happiness. Love. A world without hatred or fear. I
  believe this program will allow me to help bridge those cultural
  barriers that exist and make our world and our countries better places. I will post more of itinerary when it is available but some of
  the highlights are I will be staying with a Japanese family, living,
  breathing and learning their unique culture. My goal is to absorb
  their culture and way of life first hand while promoting ours here in
  the United States. We will be working with local Japanese students and
  various businesses on community service projects and visiting
  historical sites and monuments. Some examples of sites we are visiting
  are the city of Hiroshima and its historical significance along with
  the impact of what this meant for the world, and Sadako Sasaki’s
  monument where we plan on leaving a paper crane as a token of peace. I plan to keep everyone informed of my activities with pictures
  and possibly a blog website letting them know their sponsorship is
  serving well. So please donate!! Thank you so much for your
  consideration and I look forward to sharing my experiences with you ☺ “At the center of non-violence stands the principle of love.” Martin

"One Backpack, Chasing Dream and Moment in Europe ""Dreams are like stars, you may never touch them, but if
      you follow them they will lead you to your destiny."" ~ Anonymous The Dream I always have this dream to travel around the world when I was
  growing up as a kid in a small town in Malaysia. Back then I asked
  myself if I am given a chance, where would the place that I really
  want to go. I knew deep down in my heart, it said Europe, specifically
  Paris. I have this unknown affection towards Europe in general. “Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.”~ Helen
      Keller The Journey Few months ago, this childhood dream once again knocked the door of
  my heart. Where am I supposed to make the dream true if I always find
  excuses not to go for it? Adventurous or nothing? This time I made the
  decision, hopefully the right one, to listen my heart to travel in
  Europe on one backpack. ""Moment are meant to keep in such way when we look back and
      we can feel it again.""~ Andrew Law The Moment The objective of this trip is not only to chase my childhood dream,
  and also to pursue my passion to collect each moment in Europe. When I
  am studying abroad in United States, I start having this passion to
  keep every significant moments of my life using photographs. I sees
  photograph as a collection of moments which will never fade away once
  it is captured. Therefore, I would want to be moment keeper and share
  these stunning moments with people I love and care. Euro Trip I will be spending my three weeks winter break to travel these cities
  in Europe. The first landing city is Madrid, following by Barcelona,
  Paris, Zurich, Munich, Venice, Rome and Athens. I will travel these
  cities by eurail train. During these time, I will stay in low cost yet
  provide meaningful experience accommodation like international youth
  hostel or couch surfing where I know I will meet a group of passionate
  backpackers there. Fund will be used to partially cover my 25 days expense
  including meals, transportation and entrance fee in Europe which is
  approximately 75 Euros (USD 100) per day. Add-on: Europe Instax Series The photos above is my personal project, 'Lehigh Instax Series.' A series
  of instax photo with Lehigh building as background which aims to bring
  you virtually tour around my scenic campus! The interesting project I
  will do over this Europe trip is Europe Instax Series which sets
  beautiful scenes as the background. As part of the project, I will print scenic photos into post card and
  send it to you who support me throughout the journey. The link for postcard address delivery is here . If you are excited about the trip as I am too, you can follow recent

"My
  mother has always been there for me, in my hardest hours and in my
  finest moments. When I was a child, she was always closely involved at my school,
  baking cupcakes for me to bring to class on holidays and helping me
  with difficult reports and projects until the bitter end. She went the
  extra mile so that we could partake in music lessons, sports and other
  enriching activities. She always encouraged me to follow my dreams and
  believed in me every step of the way. When I was a teenager, our house burned down and instead of feeling
  sorry for us, she packed up the van and took us on a life changing
  road trip down the West Coast, through Oregon and California, to the
  Grand Canyon and back up through Idaho, hitting all of the exciting
  spots on the way. Now, in her 50's she is following her dream. She is my inspiration. 
  She started mushing at 52 and at 55 she ran her first Iditarod and
  made it all the way to Nome.   It is never too late to follow your
  dreams. She loves to visit school kids and share her Journey...her Iditarod
  2012.  A story of Determination, Strength and Courage.    With her dog
  team, she travelled 1049 miles across Alaska.  She not only
  experienced extremely challenging trails, but with it came
  temperatures to - 50, extreme winds and ground blizzards, not to mention an angry moosel.
   My mother and her dogs made it all the way to Nome on her Rookie
  Iditarod.   I am so proud of her.  She is an inspiration not only to
  the school children she visits, but to all that she shares her passion
  with. She signed up for Iditarod 2014 and I want to be there for her.
  Iditarod auctions off each Iditarod Musher's sled bag for the
  Ceremonial Start in down town Anchorage.   I won the bid and will be
  the Iditarider in my mother's sled, traveling together for 11 miles
  throught the streets of down town Anchorage.  I imagine this picture
  with me in the sled ! More than anything, I want to be there in her sled at the Ceremonial
  Start.  I want to be there for her as she has always been there for
  me.  I want to send my mother off on her epic journey through the
  great, wild Alaskan tundra with her incredible dogs, attempting what
  few humans have dared to accomplish.  Over 3000 people have summited
  Mt. Everest.  Only 718 mushers have successfully finished the
  Iditarod.  Only 120 of the finishers were women. This is an experience of a lifetime for both my mother and me.  A
  memory that will be created together, to hang onto for the rest of our
  lives. You can help make this dream a reality by helping me cover the cost
  of my bid and my travel from Vienna to Anchorage.  In exchange I will
  write about the experience and share photos and stories on my blog.

"THE GRADUATE SCHOOL EXPERIENCE:Writing a Master's Thesis for a Master of Arts program during Graduate school sounds logical and expected in every sense. However, writing a thesis is not always required in all graduate programs. For The College of Saint Rose, writing a Master's Thesis is entirely optional, and not for the faint of heart, nor the short of will. Writing a Master's Thesis requires an additional semester of schooling with the added pressure of student bills. However, one additional semester is usually not enough to complete the project. A typical Master's Thesis is usually at least fifty pages and takes upwards of two years to complete.MY EXPERIENCE:My Master's Thesis began in 2009 when I read the novel Infinite Jest for a summer seminar. For me, this novel was a game-changer that set my course of studies into an entirely new direction. The following semester I signed up to read the novel again for a Contemporary Narrative course. It was then that I decided to do an Advanced Project on the novel, this project being a requirement of every graduate at Saint Rose. When I finished the Advanced Project, I didn't feel done, nor fulfilled, nor finished for that matter, so I requested the opportunity to write a Master's Thesis. The authority to allow the opportunity to write a Thesis comes from a panel of advisers/professor who work directly with the project as well as a grade of at least an A-. I was granted approval and I recently defended my Thesis to this same panel of advisers who congratulated me on my intrepid work and who I look forward to working with closely, even though I am officially no longer a student at the College of Saint Rose.WHAT'S NEXT:The completion of a Master's Thesis is truly an achievement in and of itself. I already teach as an Adjunct instructor at a local Community College, but the reality for teachers is that they have to have an impressive history of publications, conferences, and scholarly endeavors to be considered for tenure track or even full-time work. I am lucky that to have had the opportunity to create such high scholarship, but now the world needs to see it. I still work directly with my panel of advisers to get my Thesis out there to be published and heard, but the process of being a world-scholar as well as a world traveler can leave any part-time employee broke even at the expense of something they're so passionate about. WHAT YOU'RE FUNDING:""Multiplicities: Mapping Identity through Literature"" is a Graduate student conference hosted by The Department of English and the Division of Languages and Literature at Saint Louis University, Madrid Campus. I have been accepted to present a section of my Master's Thesis written in partial fulfillment of a Master of Arts degree at the College of Saint Rose. Your funding will afford the opportunity for my Master's Thesis to be both seen and heard all the way across the treacherous waters of the Atlantic to the buzzing metropolis of Madrid, Spain. -Donors will receive endless thank you's and the opportunity to celebrate passion about what we choose to do for a living.-I know I signed up for struggle and hardship when I chose scholarship in English Literature as my career focus, but I did it because I love it, because the career challenges me, and whenever I get into the classroom I know that I'm right where I want to be.-Please share in this experience with me...any contribution is so much appreciated already. Thank you,Danielle","1,050",of $1k goal,https://fundrazr.com/3Gdmb,Mapping Careers Through Experience,8,U.S. Dollar

I want to take the opportunity to tell you about one of my fundraising ventures.  I am planning a beach run-not ON the beach but TO the beach.  I will be leaving from Manchester NH on Friday April 20th and running approximately 20 miles (hopefully more).  On Saturday I will pick up where I left off and finish the run when I arrive at Hampton Beach.  I am looking for people to sponsor my run by donating either a pledge per mile (40 miles) or a lump sum donation.  20% of the funds I raise will be donated to Susan G. Komen for the Cure of breast cancer in honor of my Grandmother and my Aunt Eileen.  Would you be willing to sponsor my run?  You can make a secure online donation right here on my page.  Please feel free to contact me directly to discuss my fundraising efforts.  Some friends will join me for sections of my run and both family and friends will join me at the finish line.

"For 20 days in June 2012, God has offered me the chance to go to France, Italy & Greece with People to People Ambassador Program. This 20-day  Mission is simply “to bridge cultural and political borders through education and exchange, making the world a better place for future generations.” While God has opened up a door for me to develop a greater heart of compassion for His people around the world, the exciting part is that you will be able to share in this compassion in several ways. First, you can help pray for me and my fellow students. We will need prayers that God will prepare us for our visit and bless our efforts as we learn about these cultures. We will also need prayers that our financial needs will be met. At this time I need to raise quite a bit  more to attend this trip, and that is quite a challenge! Whether you feel led to contribute financially, through prayer, or both, all of your support is appreciated.

"Yes, Warbeast is asking for your help again! We were really hoping that we wouldn’t still be asking for support at this point. But the truth is that we still need all the donations we can get. WARBEAST has the privilege and honor to be going on tour with the legendary DOWN in September. But once again the gas prices have skyrocketed right after we got confirmed for the tour.  Gas prices have went up everywhere an average of 40 cents since early July. Chances are they will just continue to rise. We will be traveling about 4,500 on this 2 week tour.  Our Van only gets about 9-10 miles per gallon. So if you figure all of that with gas prices that are almost $4.00 a gallon… well you can do the math. Warbeast isn’t a band that is doing this to make money. But we can’t always lose money if we want to survive as a band. As some of you know… Warbeast has also already asked for help with places to crash out on this upcoming tour. Obviously to save on getting Hotel rooms during the tour. Now we are hoping to we can get some much needed aid when it comes to filling up our gas tank. All of us in Warbeast respect our families, friends and fans.  We have integrity and in no way would we ever try and take advantage of any of them.  But the fact is… we have lost money on every tour and we will probably lose money again on this tour.  That’s just the way it is… but we still continue to do these tours because it’s what we love to do and we believe in this band. Some of our members have to take off work from their jobs just to be able to do these tours.  So that is basically just like missing weeks of paychecks. Then they get like a $10.00 or $15.00 per diem a day during the tour and a meal at the shows.  So just imagine the financial loss some of us take just to do these tours.In other words, it’s tough these days for a band.  We aren’t too proud to admit we still need help and support.  Yes, great things are continuing to happen for Warbeast on the outside.  But when it comes to the financial part… just know that we are just trying to keep afloat when we do ask for help.  Any contribution you can make would be greatly appreciated from all of us in Warbeast… THANKS IN ADVANCE!!!","1,392",of $1.2k goal,https://fundrazr.com/eLrI6,WARBEAST TOUR SUPPORT FUND!,36,U.S. Dollar

If you are interested in learning more and being involved, read on! :) A little background: last summer we went to the town of Orange Walk, Belize, with our church's youth. It was our first time, the youth group's third trip there. Rikke and I, along with another church member, Matt Eilers, were asked to go to look into adding another trip, at a different time of year, for a multi-age group of folks. It would be a way to further support this needy community and build the ""sister-church"" relationship that has been developing with El Buen Pastor, the church with which we partner. The work would include a children's program, some construction, perhaps visiting people to provide food staples, and encouraging the local church. So, Belize II is now for real; the team is developing and set to be there November 8-15th. Both Rikke and I hope to go this year. The faith stretchers: $1,500 for each of us; organizing and leading the group; arranging the logistics for our family, kids and dog that stay behind; total funds are due by September 1st. We appreciate your prayers as we discern the ""shape"" of this endeavor!

I had started the mental processes for saying goodbye to this rescue from GA who nobody else wanted to or could save from the kill shelter he was being held in. He was older, and had a large fatty mass hanging from his back leg. Long story short, Wufers has had the surgery to remove the mass that has enabled him to walking with much greater ease. We have had Wufer since June. I was not ready to give up on him and on Monday morning took him to our vet to see what could be done. After tests he was hospitalized for two days for IV treatments for hepatitis, anemia, and dehydration. He's doing much better and is resting now at home. My costs for his care is $500.00. At the same time as Wufer was going down on Sunday, I took on and committed to rescuing a little Mini Eskie sitting on death row in the East valley LA shelter. I have had him pulled to safety and is in temp fostering till I can fly him to me in Chicago. I have already invested $150.00 for his release so far. His flight to Chicago including health certificate, kennel, and ticket will run close to $350.00. I have now reached the $550.00 investment mark for the East Valley rescue, now named Paulie.He travels to me on Tuesday.

I'm jealous!....and also ill-equipped financially to afford this ;0, sooooo, we are raising money on many fronts (I will be selling a variety of beef sticks and jerky products and Madison, her Mom, and I may handcraft some Zombie felties for big donors!) But our friends and family will be the biggest advantage in this endeavor....as always!",870,of $3.6k goal,https://fundrazr.com/bNqC1,Send Madison Packing!!,5,U.S. Dollar
